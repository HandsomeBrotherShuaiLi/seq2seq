I really love the patterns formed by wind blown sand upon rocks . <eou> I know what you mean , I love being outside in nature in general . <eou> I prefer to go to the beach and search for rocks that have been washed with sand to form little pebbles . <eou> The beach is great , I don ' t get to go very often . I ' m more of a lake person . <eou> I live quite close to the ocean so I am able to find them on a daily basis . Our beach is considered a shingle beach as it has many pebbles . <eou> Interesting , the beaches that I ' ve been to have only had fine sand . But there is always algae in the water . <eou> I love living next to the sea as it moderates Earth ' s climate and plays a very important roll in the cycle of carbon , nitrogen and water . <eou> That ' s why I think we need to be more aware of the health of our ocean because it does play such a big role in the overall environment . <eou> I totally agree as well ; many many times I take a bag with me just to pick up what others have left behind on the beach to help wildlife sustain a living space free of trash . <eou> 	That ' s a good idea , I ' ve never thought of that .

I have always wanted a pet skunk . I ' m not sure if that ' s a good idea though . <eou> It certainly seems risky as the animals are known for their ability to spray a liquid with a strong , unpleasant smell . <eou> Can you get their sprayer fixed so it can ' t do that anymore ? <eou> I ' m not sure honestly , and that seems kind of unethical in my opinion . I do know that skuns are omnivorous , meaning they eat both plant and animal material . <eou> You have a good point . That wouldn ' t be very nice . Probably not a good idea for a pet . I didn ' t know they were omnivorous either . <eou> I ' m glad you agree , I also read that all skunks are striped , even from birth , how neat is that ? <eou> That is really neat . I guess it ' s better just to learn about them than to keep them in captivity .

I love The Beatles , Love Me Do is one of my favorite songs of theirs , made all the way back in late 1962 . <eou> The Beatles are a classic , when did they first form ? <eou> I believe they formed in Liverpool in 1960 . <eou> Such a long time ago , arguably the biggest band of all time , had such a massive impact on the music industry . Who was your favorite member ? <eou> It has to be Ringo Starr , who didn ' t join until 1962 after they tried a few other drummers , guess he was that good they knew he was the one . <eou> Im a John Lennon guy myself , tragic what happened to him , sadly we have some sick and twisted people in this world . <eou> It is quite sad , mental illness is quite the big topic nowadays given our current culture . I was quite fond the songwriting partnership he formed with McCartney myself . <eou> My favorite of theirs is probably A Day in the Life , they wrote so many famous songs . <eou> Their popularity is certainly enermous , it ' s not wonder it was called Beatlemania , it really was like a mania . <eou> 	Yea it might be a while till we see a band of that impact on the industry .	love favorite songs theirs late <eou> classic form <eou> believe formed <eou> ago time arguably massive band biggest impact music industry favorite <eou> drummers join guess tried <eou> sick guy people happened sadly world tragic twisted <eou> culture mental current partnership formed fond songwriting nowadays sad topic illness <eou> probably wrote famous songs theirs favorite <eou> popularity mania wonder called <eou>  <expand> like people being person dance music record art joy pain club history slang medicine group uk date doll bell song recent time news dead past class general play organization continent place humans good great kind darling human score life value war live favor website liked color harp favorable friend internet protest run christmas period event literature twist loop business cry thought mass drop man line body space information former question work bread head plate tie action think stitch metal present relative future now stale term go rest unit musical issue related rock band stage culture country popular subject fashion company memory doctor home happy melomania emotions relationship romance feeling child god blind wedding peace marry object big british bed passion academic deep birthday family marriage philosophy leave worship euphemistic living always material emotion sing day admire bookmark choice favour favy taw favo unfavorite favoritism preferred favoriting nostrum favorites favorably favorited favicon cofavorite favourite fave favoritest pot album melodic note verse mine new after rush modern artist money water biology statue fill heading formedness little movement sign circle democracy lead biform strain language paper type social school cut round be roll out idea formable republic judge heat popularise computing physical biformed suspect have having belief feel imagine pray form manufacture long description measurement seven down snap measure break nothing vary dream glory set energy arsis everything fast division motion party game output split camp contemporary physics quality fusion ocean cathedral beautiful ground lattice nice horse bind march bend air ring dancing concert drummer alone part shock fun bad rap put movie together folk sick americana area civilization trade joint unknown us disease sneeze disturbed hospital health sickness cold nation name colony earth society today mood depression condition baby kiss respect lie philozoic forever forgive sigh bond grace affection lovemap paint adore

Skateboarding is a hobby of mine , I am not good at it , but I like it <eou> I used to skateboard , but I really didn ' t have a lot of tricks up my sleeve .

The only extreme sports event I used to watch was the X Games for it ' s first few years . I ' ve been out of it for a while . <eou> It is amazing how far Tony Hawk took the sport , and that he still dabbles in it , but his oldest son skates too <eou> I remember playing his original video game . Tony Hawk ' s Pro Skater on the N64 . That was really awesome back in the day . <eou> It was on the n64 , it was really cool hoe you could sometimes skate through the walls .. lol ... I like the tricks like the ollie <eou> I remember once I learned to do an ollie myself , I tried to move to the kickflip .

I love me some Netflix ! Do you like it ? <eou> Yeah I love Netflix , which is an American company . <eou> Yes , and they sure have became very popular . I bet they are in the top of their league , compared to other companies ? <eou> Netflix really took the lead over other companies like Blockbuster . <eou> Yes , and I think they are pretty much out of business almost everywhere now . I imagine they may be doing better than Dish Network and Direct TV too ? <eou> They must be , since cable is dying . Netflix was founded back in August 1997 . <eou> I had no idea it had been around that long , so I guess it has taken some time to rise to the top . Do you have a favorite Netflix show ? <eou> Of all the shows on Neflix , I really like the show Trailer Park Boys . It isn ' t American though , it ' s Canadian . Unlike Netflix the company . <eou> I had no idea it had been around that long , so I guess it has taken some time to rise to the top .

I was thinking about becoming a yoga instructor but I don ' t know much about it . Do you ? <eou> I do . The word yoga means " listen " in Sanskrit . It ' s a group of practices of both a physical and spiritual bent . <eou> Oh really ? Listen ....... that is interesting . I guess listen to your body ? <eou> Kind of , yes . In India where yoga comes from , it is more than physical exercise . Meditation and spirituality are also an important part of the practice . <eou> Oh yes I have heard this as well . I have been learning to meditate recently . :) <eou> Meditation is a great way to reduce stress and anxiety . Meditative practices also originated in Asia . <eou> Yeah , they are all very spiritual people in that part of the world . I would love to visit there one day . <eou> It ' s a wonderful part of the world . It was actually yoga gurus from India who brought yoga to the West . <eou> Yes , they are so merciful to bring this knowledge to the west . We are so fortunate ! <eou> Indeed we are . If you ' re looking to get into yoga , the two most popular types are Hatha yoga and Raja yoga .

In some institutions a bachelors degree is a graduate degree not an undergraduate degree . <eou> For real ? How does that even work ? <eou> The student can ' t start a bachelor degree until a first degree has been completed , probably like an AA . <eou> And then when applying for jobs do you think it makes a difference ? Like I want to get a master ' s so I ' ll be slightly more valuable to potential employers . <eou> Really depends on your profession , in some cases a masters degree can make you too valuable and companies wont hire you , in most cases its a good thing to have a masters though . what are you trying todo ? <eou> Well I ' m a biologist by training , but I really want to work at the CDC . I was thinking about getting a master ' s in microbiology because just a four year degree isn ' t usually enough for these government agencies . <eou> masters should definitely help , its sounds counter intuitive but if you go for a phd it can make it easier to get your schooling for free . at least it does in engineering <eou> I actually thought about pursuing a PhD after college , but I felt that I wasn ' t smart enough to get into any labs . <eou> if you can get into a masters program , it shouldnt be too hard to get into a lab just gotta network and get in with the right people . <eou> 	That ' s probably true . It also depends on the program . I also really like to write and I was in an online writing program for a little while .

My girlfriend and I enjoy watching Disney ' s animated theatrical films , like The Little Mermaid . Do you watch them ? <eou> Yes ! I grew up with those films .

He was funny <eou> Olaf and a lot of the other characters ended up being too symbolic in the screenplay drafting process .

Hans , Kristoff , Anna , Sven <eou> Kristoff reminds me of me when I was in my early twenties : tall , rugged , and handsome . I definitely qualify for that last one ... <eou> Haha , im more like sven or Olaf <eou> It would be a great drinking game to play .

So something interesting about me . I ride unicycle , a bike - like thing with only one wheel . <eou> that amazing , i have no sense of balance so even riding a bike is hard for me <eou> It is surprisingly easy once you get used to it . There are even activities for unicyclists that are similar to mountain biking trials . <eou> the only thing i know about unicycles that they were make in the 1870s <eou> Yes there were a couple patents . One by Frederick Myers and the other by Battista Scuri . <eou> how do you control it when you hit big bumps with no handle bars <eou> When a rider is on the unicycle it is unusually stable . With a trained rider they are said to be more stable than a bicycle . <eou> 	i wonder how that is because you only have one wheel , and less balance	ride wheel unicycle bike <eou> balance sense bike hard amazing riding <eou> similar biking trials activities mountain surprisingly unicyclists easy <eou> 1870s unicycles <eou> couple patents <eou> hit handle control bumps bars <eou> rider bicycle unicycle stable unusually trained <eou>  <expand> bicycle car slang travel ride vehicle move drive motorcycle transport bike saddle handle boat riding horse lift train biking cycling override roller spoke metal fast sprocket computing seat like rest scorcher wave movement walk road jockey shank activity mount smooth translation lock ball handlebar part toe brake caddie helm monowheel multicycle power equilibristics tricycle monocycle unicyclist cycle scooter bikable garage bikejor antibike bikeless pedal crash skybike grip velodrome bikeporn railbike bikeshed bikelike bikery bikeshare street bikepacking bikewear skid scotland biker bikemaker device person nautical middle equal touch sound heaven ground hammer difficulty gentle box shell exercise cover board stick music pot knob point top hand us whip hold use rider uk copulate being quadrille climb scorch trip action horses nag soigneur gallop two fun nonriding park traveling passenger skating canter velocipede outride dialect backie prance bicyclist brevet shock wheels horseriding transportation horserider out ridership nonrider sail go coaster bucket wheelset segway gripe handwheel skibob awheel freewheel steering wheelsucker castor skateboard crankset mobile wheel cogset celeripede trunk track turn object wheelie force ladle skibobbing wildcat driver first influence axe mudguard acrobat unicycled unicycles unicycling stationary commuting byke hornet ant musclebike hive aquabike bikie dirtbike trike biketard racebike welbike handbike skibike bikeway bee biked wasp hoverbike derogatory minibike messenger bikelash hyperbike unike ironman hog bikepacker sportbike bikes motor litrebike collective nest superbike bikeathon waterbike bitser strike cancel regulate structure compare amount equilibrioception equilibratory skill balanced square match gymnastics steady compensator steelyard weight scale level beam gambling difference awareness clear wonder memory river feeling salt goshwow easiness tosh lug mathematics ear common lord ninja strong feel reference mouth brick case science ease egg smash hardly difficult office tough rocky hardened adjective rock drop hardtail branch liquor steel description tree blow tight hardship intemperate rub iron baseball stale slope effort simple work diamond uneath
Sculpting or sculpture is a branch of the fine arts . It is visual in nature , and it operates in three dimensions . Do you know much about sculture ? <eou> No I don ' t but I would like to know more <eou> The sculptural process originally was performed in two ways . First was carving ; that is , the removal of material from a block of wood or stone , for example . The second way is modelling , which is the addition of material ( clay for example ) on another material . <eou> sounds very cool please tell me more about it <eou> In the early period of sculpting , such as the classical period , for the most part materials were limited to stone , metal , ceramics , and wood . However , since " Modernism ," the materials used are almost limitless . <eou> Very interesting is there anything else I should know about scultping ? <eou> If you are interested in sculpting , and you want it to stand the test of time , the best material to use is stone . Other materials , such as wood , perish quite quickly in the process of time . Sculpting with pottery is your second best option if you find stone too difficult to sculpt . <eou> 	Good info thanks a lot for sharing	fine branch visual nature dimensions arts sculpture operates <eou> don <eou> carving clay modelling material stone block process removal performed addition wood sculptural example originally <eou> please tell cool sounds <eou> limited limitless stone classical sculpting wood period metal materials ceramics <eou> else <eou> time option material sculpt stone process sculpting difficult test wood quickly pottery perish materials stand <eou>  <expand> like art wood construction hard bar slang set grain paint stone statue substance material matter metal generic house term music small glass building paper making product chisel ground stick river general coal printing solid table bed make sand fire nest tree british computing type nature earth natural stage sculpture clay brick chair work door plate stuff vitreography buildings opaque fabrile polished painted burn case run being legal dust stop issue point cut person out head wooden color place magazine made chemical box wash column throw form mineral cinder vitrification rock polish steel plastic makeup raw bullet page floor killock tracery hammer carved framesaw bookmatch dutchman woodstone tessera dead cross sectility jigsaw dance finish surface literature texture smooth rough water element split build little part bird program division big bigger trees plant forests component forest science camp manufactured organic quality chop shape chiaroscuro muller round modeling ironstone earthen cleat crucible fibreboard pulp cement treehouse cardboard cork lagging lapping aggregate jade firewood flesh combustible flag hood snow murrhine any fiberboard diamond fiber dirt board flooring nail band chill mass mine quarter measuring weight heavy draw seed go fall tail collagraphy clearing generator roundwood primer age morning year post before resource related money good uk pollard salt time how refine cricket rest heartwood sapwood piece kesh bangle branches stream smaller sticks trunk also fork arkansas knag appendage train brown large wicker stem bark knot woody bit deadwood qualified woodflesh reading state koala plants consider physical hardstone boscage study xylopyrography ringstone monolith marble sarcophagus england sandalwood linenfold scrimshaw pencil temper slip pot claystone gumming usa stean mudstone claycourt pipestone variation atom ballot mind epiphenomenalism infeed reprographics micronisation pultrusion information materials immunization story property stationery asbestos recycling medicine peel stoneware millstone anvil cystolithotomy gray st coldness name holystone sweep liberty grave kill hardness cornerstone calculus

Hi , I know far too little , but have always been interesting in Bible study . <eou> To start off , the Bible is pretty much just a record of the relationship between humans and God . <eou> I believe it also to be a guide for the best way to live our lives . <eou> Many different authors contributed to the Bible with their sacred scriptures . <eou> I totally agree . Though many would disagree , the Bible is the Only book that contains absolutely No contradictions . <eou> There is some disagreement among different denominations . Protestants focus on scripture alone , while roman catholics stress harmony . <eou> This is true . I personally do not believe in denominations . Christ established His church . All others are corruptions created by man . <eou> Denominations or not , nowadays there is a total of more than two billion Christians worldwide . <eou> Professing to be Christian does not make it so . <eou> 	This is true , but at least in the US , the majority of people report that religion plays a very important role in their lives .	little study <eou> humans start pretty record relationship <eou> believe lives guide live <eou> sacred contributed authors scriptures <eou> contradictions book agree contains disagree absolutely totally <eou> focus catholics scripture harmony disagreement stress roman denominations <eou> believe established true corruptions church personally created denominations <eou> nowadays worldwide total billion <eou>  <eou>  <expand> like think book action people person statement very world music read legal object live be degree note nest two body tally take learn play dictionary house know being listen fact writing information believe religious can religion yes accept place psalm bible city discord baby slang large doll card squirrel seed history thought enlightenment population journal skepticism university mathematics school practice text work law studio education synagogue arm voice bone circle sleep age black earth now have sports turn complete starting face number historical document album right page device computing job romance state ship suspect believer truthful subscribe ascribe alieve faith understand amazingly pray b god life living audience holy scripture character word magazine dissent disagreeable agreement protest certain mass ecumenicalism denomination bear emotional selfish cafe rap matter piece kitten adjective means daughter children smaller tees slightly hamlet dog priest mole lead pore worm quantity small monkey name crowd description rabbit big describing quiet parish street petty mean cut minute change plain somewhat stone amount bit prairie test chop girl analysis concentrate knowledge physician attention logic biology museum desk horse see room ecclesiastics genealogy harmony class literature research geography studying paleanthropology crammer artwork reading concentration academic bookmate contemplate look learning publication electronics art report biometeorology material prosopography bookcase lie nice dream wedding run alive human destroy share country habitable eye air die cell born blood draw act command move motion plough surprise movement plant come line appearance early finish button end depart contents video quickstart menu level go point light genesis proper hot fair song silk lady expression bad bar quite column apostle copy row cashbook cartulary newspaper business maintain musical keeping workbook holder has flat function collection time booking make bookkeeper table navigate medium post add listening data testament register attested ancient but sheet wax storage singing back grooved ledger

Do you know of any goods ones ? <eou> Yes I like all the Halloween movies and all the Purge movies <eou> I think I have watched Halloween before ! That ' s the one that takes place in Haddonfield , Illinois ! What are the Purge movies about ? <eou> Purge is scary about one night a year when people can commit any crime including murder without consequences , very scary ! <eou> That would be a pretty scary world to live in . Do you think it ' s better than the film " Scream "? I know it ' s a bit dated , coming out in 1996 , but it ' s still a great movie . <eou> Never saw scream ? I like the Silence of the Lambs too , that is a real horror flick ! <eou> Yes ! I love Silence of the Lambs !

I am not yet a parent , but it will be interesting to raise a child and learn good parenting skills . I ' d like to be a " good parent ". <eou> I am not a parent yet either but I couldn ' t agree more I definitely think it is important to try and be the best parent you can be ! <eou> Parenting seems like a process of predictable sequences , but they may turn out different for each child . <eou> That ' s a good point , I guess every child is different so they probably each deal with parenting styles differently . <eou> I ' ve heard that the quality of parenting likely matters more than the amount of time spend with the child . <eou> I guess it is the time you spend with them that counts , having to make the time really important and really appreciating the years you have with them ! <eou> That ' s very true . In some cases , society also plays an important role in raising a child as well . <eou> That ' s true also , I sometimes worry the world we are living in now will be detrimental to the way children are raised . Those so much in the world that can have such huge impacts . <eou> I agree , it is hard . Studies tend to have trouble identifying the impacts because respondents often respond to feel ideal rather than how things are . <eou> 	I think you ' re right , a lot of times we paint a pretty picture when things may actually be fairly tough .	learn skills parenting child am parent raise <eou> try agree am parent definitely <eou> child predictable sequences process <eou> probably parenting child guess styles deal <eou> time parenting child amount spend matters ve quality heard <eou> time counts guess appreciating spend <eou> child true role raising society plays <eou> huge children true detrimental raised impacts living world sometimes worry <eou> tend respondents respond feel trouble agree hard identifying impacts ideal <eou>  <expand> person being adopt legal child play issue action father mother age people think sharenting parent little name object human game computing childrearing place animal member boy family relative punishment school role overparenting grandparenting birth underparenting adulthood parents visitation up daughter pain small generic childmind old nature breedermobile mom reproducing term parentification act learning baby general ground postremogeniture kid kids toy defiliation years subdatasheet brother children middleborn filicide man parenting traditive onlyborn orphan parentectomy thirdborn filioparental half offspring polyhierarchy big comfort foster teknonymy filiation childtime doll kafala single product cytula goldensprog childhood try chicken secondborn floortime music money uk work go life condition experience pseudoconcept student fun everyone listen teaching scuffle loving upbringing ball egg childrens female paracosm something one nice low chylderyn trouble support barn childism young puberty childproof nonparturient specifically tike few childlove chocolate son subshell wane fry descendant families childcare love innocent preteen raising brat hide youth pig house cultural culture adult adolescent reach feely item operation paste tribe born childraising antichildren breathe their minder grown tyke childs process progeny juvenile spank procreate girl make pass slang like case value interest art level parenthood scooter babbling diaper childfucker kidcom poppet preschooler hamas snicklefritz wagon infantometer burdalane childlover either lost misopaedia trilling pushpin its access anything fourling an spawn pipel abandonment kiddiewinkie adoption puerperous learn chrisom playpark considered childing baba tiddler stepcousin unchild alanna fatherling pedotrophist playgrouper rugrat grounded jam aacap playstreet childkind derive derivative only swapling creche babery imp mokopuna fucklet nestling regardless auxodrome gett autonomous savior breastaurant nonchild kiddo capacocha abishag figurative naughty kiddlywink infantilize boredom littlun womanchild shaver everykid dilling candy childless exterogestation orling has grandcat childbearing statementing pup elfin piecer bottine playmat nipper firstborn descendantless elder cyberkid weanling putto enlevement childspeak playdate retrogenesis childish tecno pederosis childship subservient redshirt brainchild genophilia unschool postconceptionally kiddy amphidromia
Everywhere i went today , people kept mentioning beer . When you are a recovering alcoholic like me , you don ' t want people mentioning your weakness all of the time . <eou> Man , that is tough . And good on you for staying strong . Too many people do too many stupid things on alcohol -- driving drunk , risky decisions ... too much . <eou> My wife says my weakness is english grammer , but i know it is alcohol . I sometimes crave a drink around holidays , <eou> Understandable . It ' s supposed to be " festive ", right ?! And no doubt on the grammar , as alcohol makes a beeline for the brain ( and other organs , like the heart , liver , pancreas ....!) <eou> Yes , alcohol will kill you . i used to be a scotch drinker , because scotch is not measured by the shot . Scotch is a free pour , so you get half a water glass worth . That is about 3 shots for the same price as a shot of Tequila . <eou> Ah , well , and there you hit on my preferred tipple . Tequila . And I had no idea about scotch ! So how do you stay true to * not * drinking ? <eou> Drinking makes it hard to type , so i was forced to choose between using the internet or drinking . Hopefully i made the right choice . <eou> You know what ? I ' m cheering for you . Obviously your brain is way to beautiful to waste . ( And the spectre of cirrhosis , increased risk of cancer , etc .... good motivation ) <eou> Thanks . If you try scotch , stay away from the blends like Johnny Walker , they are like jet fuel . Many of the single malt scotches are quite nice and drinkable . <eou> Roger that . I ' ve got Scot in my blood , so I ' m thinking my body would rebel against anything less than a single malt . <eou> 	Scotch is like Tequila . Both of their home countries have strict laws which govern their ingredients and manufacture . Jack Daniels can make his rotgut any way he wants .	time recovering people alcoholic don weakness kept beer mentioning <eou> stupid people decisions risky tough driving drunk staying alcohol strong <eou> crave drink grammer wife english holidays alcohol sometimes weakness <eou> festive organs brain grammar makes beeline heart liver pancreas supposed doubt alcohol <eou> measured half water kill 3 pour price free worth scotch shot drinker alcohol glass shots <eou> hit tipple true idea scotch stay drinking preferred <eou> internet hard choose makes using choice type drinking forced <eou> risk etc increased brain cheering beautiful cancer motivation spectre waste cirrhosis <eou> try scotches blends fuel malt jet drinkable stay scotch nice single <eou> body malt rebel thinking blood ve single <eou>  <expand> person drink party slang bar beverage alcoholic animal alcohol dance liquor stale body scotch beer wine action heat double uk being rest head ground slug water liquid class case life run bone shake human us point whiskey rum bottle like wax glass mind kill drop general sleep money issue think people good pub dry gin drunk swill drunkenness ale oil liver drinks spirit mist cell generic break energy stop force home bad blood group crowd feet bear drinking malternative shot flask maltworm saloon pot plane smoke iron cut intoxication pledge act dialect wood cloud flea turn dream property tap out unit number leave war thinking swim choke alcoholics child pain market office machine memory intelligent coat man poison common bullet medicine vodka proof whisky cocktail scotland fridge substance rub finger organic mathematics sound clear taste board paper organ stroke brain object grain part vessel use music time duty reading pass go play bed bell art hand game camp fine gang show alcohology plank color band not supermarket information laugh everyone neat disease nationality street weight house purging need fair fight statue servant cast family dangerous booze hydroalcoholic congener intoxicating brandy cup tincture pulque weak keep malt container bread fool steamer description breathalyzer drive influence lightweight drunken move course bars dram triple cerebrin oh cirrhosis hangover nondrinking preload burn antidrinking nondrinker main solid metal rock blow take size inside soup writing milk silk swallow card wound sand eye hit idea perfect tree print ocean very stick score place answer short conceive measure clock record stitch age measurement fix work summer purpose snow step grammar dead physics marry sickness club bite vulgar car staff surprise judge animals capital voice dog every closet brains living manner cathedral between sequacious link stupidity transport celebrating cold humans rule horse jump intelligence love subject honest command

Did she make a lot of albums ? <eou> I think she has over 60 albums believe it or not , thats a lot . <eou> Unbelievable . She must have a good work ethic . <eou> Yea she really reinvented both her music and image while maintaining autonomy within the massive recording industry , which I hear is hard to do . <eou> Do you know where Madonna grew up ? <eou> She was Born and raised in the state of Michigan , She moved to New York City in 1978 when she first wanted to get a career in dancing . <eou> Oh cool . So she started as a dancer before she began her singing career .

I do not like dairy especially cheese because it is derived from milk that forms by coagulation of the milk protein casein . <eou> I love cheese but not a huge milk fan . <eou> Me too . Despite this , I can ' t deny the fact that cheese is popular among others and hundred of types of cheese are produced from multiple countries . <eou> Yea and they can use different types of animal milk like goats and cows <eou> The style , texture and flavor all depend on where the milk comes from and if they have been pasteurized and aging process . <eou> Yep , i love soft goats cheese but things like mozzarella and feta are awesome too <eou> Some cheese are just simply curdled milk . But some cheese incorporate herbs , spices , or wood smoke as flavoring agents . <eou> Oh yea herbal cheese is so good <eou> I also forgot to mention other ingredients like black pepper , garlic , chives or cranberries can be used . <eou> 	sounds like they would be great in cheese	milk dairy especially coagulation forms protein derived casein cheese <eou> milk huge fan love cheese <eou> multiple popular produced deny types countries hundred cheese <eou> milk goats cows types animal <eou> comes milk texture depend process flavor pasteurized aging style <eou> goats soft love awesome mozzarella cheese feta <eou> milk agents smoke incorporate wood spices curdled simply herbs flavoring cheese <eou> herbal yea cheese <eou> forgot garlic black mention cranberries pepper ingredients chives <eou>  <expand> milk slang cheese product food butter goat dairy flavor cream curdle milkhouse yogurt chèvre whey kefalograviera brie danbo dauphinoise rennin kasseri galactase fridge mozzarella mixture pule wagasi market manouri mizithra manchego ogleshield refrigerator morbier xynomyzithra cow uk baseball farm make chocolate cake material drink baby produce rice human black vegetable shake sheep caseinate mammals express white emotional software vein plate pizza salt color byproduct output casein kitchen lactivore two soda add lactoprotein protein cat feed stuff british cheesery tyromancy silk plant rennet carbonara chhurpi burrata fastball jibarito mozz malidzano cheesehead mouse cheeselike semisoft cheesewood quark aligot stromboli mold noun thing hole vulgar eye fruit affinage photography topping eaten bocconcini cheeseball alambre melt wine langos margherita like galactocele milky milkshake tits clabber milchig glass come milkcrate female secretion frikadelle produces milkshed bishop skyr ziega buttermilk milkfish milker cows cellulose products drinking young source lactoglobulin lactoperoxidase animal proteins lactage albumin say liquid lactarene agglutinin toffee curd lactaceous milkwood oyster mammal lactalbumin nectar liter think gas mess posset draw energy lactoferrin milkbox percent production milking caseinase utter coconut cambozola money reblochon angelot beaufort oaxaca panini havarti fontinella caseic pissaladière cease cave discontinue robiola burrito friulano zamojski bucheron hamburger caseous moon kd cheesylicious cheesable zerg rush fermented neuridin pate nachos gruyère pale taleggio cheesy grate kefalotyri camembert beefaroni cubano muenster fromology antipasto tyrotoxism cheeselep tylenol shag fill caseation macaroni melodramatic parmo ravioli cleese dolcelatte rind gouda limburger graviera kebbuck mousetrap carimanola types chaumes parmigiana cheesemaker stilton ricotta cheesecloth weasel dickcheese wheel cottage eurocheese derby cheswick primost cheeseweed cheeseman toma ticket livarot chipa pomace unconventional ramekin mornay arancino fromagerie pierogi provel gel taquito noncheese slipcoat manakish chhena fondue gloucester mice curtsey khachapuri asadero vell queso halloumi cheesedick turophile liederkranz asiago flaouna kreplach cheesevat cheesemonger cheesepare colby cheesefare fontina velveeta affineur pizzaburger truckle sapsago saganaki cheesology

Unfortunately I recently got divorced and I want to get back to having a social life . Do you have any advice or tips ? <eou> Sorry to hear about your divorce . What type of things do you enjoy doing ? Do you have a hobby ? <eou> I love watching TV . Friends is my favourite - especially Rachel and Monica . But thats not much of a hobby really . After my divorce is settled I will have to look into finding some new ones . <eou> Watching TV may not be the best medicine when moving on from a divorce . This is a time to rediscover you and the things that you like to do . <eou> I know the divorce just took so much out of me . We realised we just were not compatible anymore . Thinking about when I was younger - I did love dancing and played squash and the cello ?? <eou> Dancing that right there will give you an outlet to have a social life . And have you ever considered playing the cello again ? <eou> I loved the cello it is such a wonderful string instrument tuned in perfect fifths . Oh thank you , you have got me thinking about all the options now ! <eou> That ' s good because there ' s always options . One thing I hear about marriage is that you forget that you are still an individual . Now you can take care of you . <eou> That is so true . Both spouses lose their independence and when it doesnt work there are clashes , I am going to be me again !! <eou> 	The happier the individual the happier the couple I believe . And sometimes as the years go by , you grow up and grow out and become a different person than when you got married .

I love eating Bagels ! My favorite are blueberry bagels ! Do you enjoy them ? <eou> That ' s what I eat : blueberry .

Do you feel that a family can afford to live on minimum wage ? I have mixed feelings <eou> It is absolutely possible , it is just that it requires strong self control and good financial behaviors . Generally though , people who have self control and good financial mindsets can do better than minimum wage . <eou> I agree . I feel like living at such a low wage has so many drawbacks people need to figure something else out <eou> Agreed . The problem I see is that people have a sense that their poor finances are someone elses fault than their own . This attitude ensures that they won ' t apply the discipline necessary to help themselves . <eou> Do you support a wage increase ? I ' m against it but supporters say it will reduce poverty . I feel like it would give people a reason not to try to better them self <eou> I don ' t think it will reduce poverty at all . I think it will just move the bar on what begets poverity . <eou> I agree . I can understand poverty in a developing country but america offers jobs and education . <eou> Minimum wage advocates seem to believe ( incorrectly ) that people in the marketplace won ' t change their behaviors to work around the minimum wage . Humans are dynamic and adaptive , all you ' re doing is trying to stop a river with a single post . <eou> They are the same people that keep throwing people at a problem and never fixing it . I work for one of those people . I would like to see an honest study on the current living wage . <eou> 	Yeah , human beings are not commodoties .

Sleeping is one of my favorite things to do . It ' s a naturally occurring state of the body where there is inhibited consciousness and lack of interactions with your surroundings . <eou> I love to sleep , I wish I had more time to do so though ! <eou> Sleep is very important . While sleeping the body systems are in an anabolic state which helps to restore the immune , nervous , skeletal , and muscular systems . <eou> Yeah it is a great way for us to recover from everything we do throughout the day , it ' s really interesting when you think about it . <eou> It ' s also interesting that our body has an internal clock called a circadian clock that promotes sleep at night time . <eou> Yeah it is , I wonder how people deal with the long days and nights near the poles . <eou> They probably have a Non - 24 - hour sleep - wake disorder which messes with the natural sleep cycle . <eou> Yeah I hear that also causes issues with depression . <eou> Yes when someone has an irrecgular sleep - wake rhythm it can cause them to take naps throughout the day and not have a main sleep time . <eou> 	Some say smaller naps throughout the day are better for us anyway .	consciousness body surroundings occurring inhibited lack naturally interactions favorite <eou> love time wish sleep <eou> systems body sleeping restore nervous helps muscular skeletal immune anabolic <eou> day recover throughout <eou> time body internal circadian sleep night called promotes clock <eou> near wonder days people poles nights deal <eou> natural probably disorder 24 hour sleep wake messes cycle <eou> depression hear causes issues <eou> naps time throughout rhythm wake sleep cause day main <eou>  <expand> time bed dream being morning sleep short night rest dance hand person nighttime party animal month slang humans life day camp evening bear part issue physical disease hands dead event nothing home birthday long bedtime when resting go relaxing hour year hours work arise people waking bone brain class object heat sweat everything stretch tap purpose body eye physics closed like good lie date down studying reading afternoon measure clock midnight closing rem hypnogram age span wink twilight snoozetime sunset occasion measurement sleepytime watch minute period rouse action noon state nigh room death hypernychthemeral consciousness river biology waste pain turn posterior four flash human every flora wash big incarnation heart tail present none uk affair deep daytime dusk music sunburn thirty nightfall days stale sunrise modern christmas week length weather somedays timeband unit second interval late waken up diurnation circle daysleeper bedroom reawaken wake wait nap motel awaken awake dreamer mattress catch computing us disembody trance happy unconsciousness coffin swim touch burial jury type outside plank star water moon full movement cremate you total sun doll bread culture hair system living head public ground shaft collective has jump two court lose walk language cohort sinew cover material overnight shade care plant war live rhythm general seconds early light dawn pass clocks agelong keeping latter play nanosecond calendar hometime era tide minutes sunup energy months sports waketime timekeeper ephemeral someday darg chronomancy division result after round game aft hourglass tabulatable measuring meter change first noonday divisions nightguard off relaxation nocturia bundle somnologist count nest tired doze snoring slumber snore sleeping nonsleeping sleepover asleep lay eyes nightdream restorative nightly insomnia nightdreaming lying somnology drool inactivity sleepness activity hotel sheep dogs evil pillow narcolepsy duvet hibernation dreams nocturnal dreaming shop nighty sofabed book news blue self knowledge mind experience yoga bodybuilder science possess

It made 84 million at the box office , which would be a flop by today ' s standards ! <eou> Amazing how time flies ! Back then I believe it was considered a good box office . I remember there was some controversy about hidden scenes that animators put in . <eou> I am sure , I never heard of those scenes , but for a fantasy musical film , anything could be controversial in comparison , especially from disney <eou> It is amazing how animated movies used to be drawn from hand .

I think blue is the best color . What color do you think is best ? <eou> I like blue as well ! I like that it contains a mix other colors , like green , azure and even a little violet . <eou> Your mention of violet reminds me of the early spring bluebells that start to bloom in early May ! <eou> Those are blue and violet for sure ! Sometimes the distant bluebells appear more blue because of an optical effect called atmospheric perspective . <eou> Does that mean when I get closer to them they appear more purple ? I ' d love to check this out . <eou> In the middle ages , blue was used in the windows of Cathedrals . I wonder if the color changed when you got closer or more distant ? <eou> You mentioned atmospheric perspective and how it can change how we see color . What else can you tell me ? <eou> You can see blue as it lies right between violet and green on the spectrum of visible light . <eou> Does the quality of light affect how I see the colors ? <eou> 	I ' m not sure about quality of light , but I do know gender , age and culture can influence how an individual sees color .

The Inner critic in me is very intense . <eou> Everyone ' s is mine used to be crippling . I never left the house . Sometimes you have to have some self - compassion to battle those feelings in times of suffering . <eou> I try , but i just can ' t control myself most of the time . <eou> It ' s all about extending the sympathy you would have for someone else but to yourself instead . A pat on the back from myself goes a long way when I ' m down . <eou> My lack of sympathy is my biggest problem . <eou> The Greeks knew the feeling well , with " syn " meaning together and " pathos " meaning feeling . It ' s important to be sympathetic to feel a sense of community , even with yourself . <eou> I would love to be able to be part of a community , but i am to hard on people . <eou> Empathy and in general understanding others is very difficult , but it is a muscle that has to be worked to get better <eou> General understanding of others is the key for me . <eou> 	Empathy encompasses many emotional states .

I am a yoga instructor . We get together every day to practice the physical , mental and spiritual movements . <eou> That ' s awesome . I have never tried yoga ! <eou> It goes back long ago , but it is more than just exercise , you really get involved in the spiritual part of it as well . <eou> How is it beneficial spiritually ? <eou> Well it comes from Buddhism , and Hinduism , so not only is it meditative , they incorporate being at one with nature . <eou> It sounds peaceful ! Do you need to already be physically active to participate ? <eou> No , yoga is for anyone .

I love listening to bird songs . They sound so melodious to me . I could listen all day ! <eou> I like them as well , I think the high pitch is interesting in many bird songs . <eou> I didn ' t realize that ornithologists distinguish between songs ( to do with courting and mating ) and calls which are used as alarms or keeping flocks together .

I like listening to records , some people call them vinyl or vinyl records . <eou> Is that your favorite way to listen ? <eou> I like the LP the best , I like how it is made of shellac because prior records were scratchy and thick . <eou> How does it compare to digital sound ? <eou> Digital sound is really clean , but there is a nice way that the record sounds . <eou> How is the sound produced ? <eou> Well , to tell you the truth , I think it is because of sound vibrations , soundwaves that are recorded by some sort of etching ?

I like alcohol do you ? <eou> I love it even though I haven ' t drank much yet . In chemistry its basically a hydroxyl group that binds to a saturated carbon atom . <eou> ok it means , it ' s all chemicals we are drinking right ? wow , so unhealthy ! <eou> Oh yeah chemicals are so bad haha . Thankfully Rhazes distilled alcohol for the first time way back between 854 and 925 CE , otherwise we ' d be dry haha ! <eou> Amazing , that ' s a long time along . I ' m speechless <eou> I know , it ' s crazy ! Also the "- ol " at the end is to indicate that it contains a hydroxyl functional group . <eou> chemical indeed . Do you know if there is any on going research to make alcohol safer for people to drink ? <eou> 	Not as far as I know , as the risks are very hard to avoid .

I love pizza ! Especially fresh pizza . Frozen pizza just doesn ' t taste the same . <eou> I agree with you for the most part . I like Home Run Inn frozen pizza but that ' s the only frozen one I enjoy thus far . <eou> I ' ve never had it . Growing up , my dad used to buy us Ellio ' s Pizza . They were founded in 1963 in Long Island , NY . <eou> OK that has to be good , I ' m assuming that is fresh NY style pizza ? I used to live in Chicago and at that time I had some good Chicago style pizza . <eou> Actually , it was frozen pizza . It was " 9 slices " of pizza in a box comprising 3 rectangular pizzas , each divisible crosswise into three slices . I will still buy it from time to time just because it reminds me of my dad . I am not a fan of Chicago pizza . <eou> That sounds like it came with a bunch of pizza . I like bulk pizza like that which can feed a family . It ' s understandable that you don ' t like Chicago pizza coming from NY . What is your favorite style of pizza ? <eou> Thin crust . It ' s usually topped with additional vegetables or meats , but I prefer mine with French Fries on top . <eou> That ' s interesting , I have never had french fries on my pizza . I like supreme style with stuffed crust preferably . <eou> Ah , so I guess you prefer Pizza Hut . They debuted the stuffed crust pizza back on March 26 , 1995 . <eou> 	Yea I ' m a huge fan of stuffed crust since I was introduced to it , I didn ' t know it started in 1995 .	pizza taste love fresh doesn <eou> agree pizza frozen enjoy <eou> buy ve founded dad <eou> time pizza live assuming fresh style <eou> comprising 9 3 time divisible pizzas pizza rectangular buy frozen crosswise reminds am fan slices dad box <eou> bulk coming sounds feed pizza don bunch family favorite style understandable <eou> meats topped additional usually prefer vegetables crust mine top <eou> french fries pizza preferably crust stuffed supreme style <eou> prefer pizza guess crust stuffed debuted 26 <eou>  <expand> plate like bread food pizza record meat slang fruit top vegetable deliver chicken pie good person potato instance subway drink stale topping tomatoes dish pizze slice oven makeline mushrooms blue hawaiian sauce hut za pepperoni ham pizzaman crust pissaladière pizzaless pizzahead popular focaccia australiana pizzagate sfiha pizzetta panzerotto calzone nonpizza hamburger pizzas peel pizzaiolo pineapple pizzaholic flatbread cheese italian olives spoodle piece pizzalike baked manakish capricciosa sausage onions pizzalicious parmo combination restaurant plakous farinata pizzamaker margherita mozzarella pizzeria pizzaburger use action cake love birthday fish tail bar salt sound uk home toy dance object bed old new nice dash form name music class art present base soup cooking swallow baby being joy paint silk family doll fancy brand fashionable refrigerator river market rush news tree freshness getting hold think pay gallery register lifestyle stuff relative term modern stitch table sports grooming timese unit run head direction dress substance flower title computing cover surface experience what human sense quality related cheeseball preference stylish vogue physical relationship grace get god kind you giving care fresh leave life always material live hot water choice window cold tired subscribe fit snow stasis transaction play reading have time party property money choose sale guy cope be need nonstandard father short informal general place to debut early decimation habit lord game introduce terminal camp number often address swing room house board column mod rap swag gallicize fashion parnassianism ground perpendicular post steampunker botany boi process box desk hard size geology covering canelé shell purpose feeling sweet function body helping rank liking how sour eat choosing using forever attachment enjoy mate date price deep strong desire value people chick war day precious state evergreen produce catadromous cooked grass novel green soilage air aggressive presumptuous terrapin used adjective grammar similar second bargain accept shake statue stick take fun

Hi , can you tell me anything about David Mach ? I heard he was some kind of artist . <eou> Yep he is a sculptor from scotland . <eou> Interesting , what kind of sculptures does he do ? <eou> He uses mass produced objects to create works based on a flowing assemblage style . <eou> Ohh I see . Do you know where I may be able to see one of these sculptures ? <eou> A lot of his works and installations are in public spaces around Scotland . <eou> I guess I will have to try to visit some time .

The show has such dark humor , though , that it is has received a lot of backlash from the organizations like the Parents ' Television Council . <eou> That makes sense , it does seem a bit offensive in my opinion , but some people love that <eou> Yes , but is what the show is known for : offensive jokes , violence , disturbing images , and gore . <eou> That is true , like I said , to each their own , but it is not my thing ! <eou> Yes , I guess it ' s not for everyone ' s taste !

Potts and her little teacup kid , Chip , were my favorites in that movie . I love the music in these movies , too . How about you ? <eou> Yes ! I love the music too . But for some reason , the Little Mermaid had the best soundtrack to me . Part of Your World was a great song ! <eou> Oh , yes ! I still like Under the Sea , though . I like the reggae - ness of it . LOL ! <eou> I love that one too ! Part of Your World stuck out to me because it expresses Ariel ' s strong desire to become human . <eou> 	Years later and we still find ourselves singing those soundtracks in our house .

HI there , im a juggler . Do you Juggle ? <eou> I do not but always wanted to .

It goes back to the 11th century . <eou> Interesting , I wonder why people began juggling in the first place . <eou> Many reasons I ' m sure . Recreation , entertainment , art or sport . <eou> That makes sense . It is very fun ! <eou> You ' ve done it ? I think it would be fun to juggle knives , fire torches or chainsaws . <eou> I have !

ive had an xbox for 10 years now , its really cool ! do you play the xbox , are you curious about it like I am ? <eou> We have an Xbox 360 and an Xbox one but we hardly play them . <eou> Yea I remember when the The Xbox 360 came out , It was a fantastic developed by Microsoft . I play mine all the time . <eou> The only thing I hate about Xbox is having to pay for Xbox live . <eou> Well it is an online multiplayer gaming and digital media delivery service with free monthly games , So I guess it has to cost some money to run the service . <eou> Yes , But you have to pay for xbox live just to be able to watch Netflix on your system . Playstation doesn ' t charge for that . <eou> Thats wild and to think that thing sold over 24 million units sold , People really got it for the games though and didnt care at that time about netflix ect . But yeah I agree paying to watch netlfix is so dumb . <eou> I think XBoxis more popular because the graphics and games are better . <eou> Yea but when the xbox came to the United States in November 2001 , No one really cared about graphics all too much , they just wanted fun games , the original Xbox console had similar graphics to PS2 and some better in most cases . <eou> 	I remember playing Halo when it first came out . We would play in a group for hours .	10 cool curious play xbox am ive <eou> 360 hardly play <eou> time play fantastic developed 360 mine remember <eou> hate pay live <eou> service delivery run cost money multiplayer monthly digital free guess online gaming games media <eou> xbox charge system watch pay live able doesn <eou> netflix time wild sold million 24 agree dumb care didnt units games yeah watch paying ect <eou> graphics popular games <eou> similar cared xbox graphics fun games console 2001 original <eou>  <expand> like action game play rent sports camp run work time person card music board computer break party fun interest people ball joy check turn dead toy art being money tax free payment buy band use fair running function crowd playing activity due mind bill charge cost nautical control kill good present rest nothing hit do stop move enjoy pitch animal film start played notice pass playable yard croquet audience using be place see unit number think fine care price swim shop change slang computing travel pocket general fish experience involved musical movie what performance dog generic instrument date register script learning leisure magazine set discharge act record cricket legal level none sale duty stitch deliver ephemeral life period home fee company rate larp baseball away point pay almost exciting single adjective cards timeout exhaust ground kid arrow swing to player games doing reprise room daily doctor double sport formerly line two debut having interval show nativity overbid finger snap album keeper school house spin event bid diversion die exercise breath football course cover childhood in working catch playtime stuff live beat compete timekeeping tend helping stale term measure clock go passage keeping digit employment property hour current determine slow rush numbers now watch minute out plate tell punishment issue military human getting machine paid store transaction salary nonfree servant give wage buying sell purchase paying expense news support program rich feed strip trade paint movement lose casino drawer jack series tied hangman rule violent hot sweat trick boring stretch blow children bugle symphonize about cave pretending monopoly unblock puzzle kids harmonize horses ion boredom child enjoyment playground auditorium drop golf laugh harp trouble amusement lake simulate entertainment gig foul walk pedalboard mac netplay smallball interaction park thing dummy relax cast lay plight flirt combat playthrough wrestling romp grab organ boy

I have a friend that seems to be having some emotional issues with finding out that her brother has cancer . I wonder if seeing a psychologist would help ? <eou> I am so sorry to hear about your friend . I do think that is a good decision seeing that mental health is a psychologists area of expertise . <eou> Yes , I feel really bad for her , and I believe it is a kind that runs in the family , and the doctor said the siblings should check for themselves . She is really troubled by it , a psychologist may help with that part . <eou> Wow , that sounds very intense but psychologists are trained for this and can help her to improve her mental health whilst going through this rough time . they can also evaluate and come up with solutions for the entire family as well <eou> It sounds like she should definitely check into it . We live in a small town and I ' m not sure how much availability there is for a psychologists , but I think it would be helpful . <eou> I am sure she can find some more info online . But it will be a good thing if she can get evaluated so as to nip any mental disorder in the bud that may be exasperated by this event . <eou> Yes , traumatic events can sometimes elevate any underlying issues . I had a close person that was bipolar and they never sought help from a psychologist and they struggled so much , I think it would have helped them . <eou> 	Oh wow that must have been challenging for them because these disorders can really impair ones ability to personally function .

I ' m currently exercising and trying to lose weight . When you intentionally try to lose weight , it is sometimes referred to as slimming . <eou> I ' ve heard that . I went through a period of actively losing weight a year or two ago , I lost 40 pounds . How are you doing ? <eou> Well I ' ve been actively exercising for 6 weeks and I haven ' t lost a thing . Since weight loss occurs when the body expends more energy then it takes in , I must be still overeating . <eou> That ' s a likely possibility . I had to seriously pay attention to my intake , calorie counting a lot . Do you use any tools like apps or anything to help ? <eou> No , Instead of restricting the amount of calories I take in , I ' ve just been trying to stay away from sugars and starches . <eou> That can work , but you have to make sure you ' re not eating a lot more of other things by accident . It can be hard to realize how much you ' re eating sometimes . <eou> Yes , sometimes I emotionally eat . It ' s when you overeat to combat negative feelings . <eou> 	Yeah , I ' ve done that before .

I would love to learn how to play the guitar . <eou> Oh yeah ? You mean the fretted musical instrument that has six strings ? <eou> Yes . I love the sound of it . <eou> Yeah , the sound is projected acoustically using a hollow wooden or plastic box . That is what makes the sound so nice ! <eou> I prefer the acoustic guitar sound . <eou> Me too . :) If you know how to play than you know that it is played by strumming or plucking the strings with your fingers , thumb or fingernails . using the right hand .

Airplanes come in many sizes , shapes , and wing configurations . <eou> Yes , I suppose that is true . I prefer bigger planes when I fly .

My son joined Boy Scouts and I have volunteered to help the troop . I am new to Boy Scouts . <eou> That ' s pretty cool ! Boy Scouts is one of the largest private youth organizations in the US <eou> It seems rather expensive with all of the equipment we need to purchase . Will my son be a better man after graduating from Boy Scouts ? <eou> I ' m sure he will be ! He will learn a lot . Their goal is to train youth in responisble citizenship and character development <eou> My son needs that ! I have looked at the training materials , and it appears that i will need to put about 30 hours a week into this project . After work i am tired . i ' m not sure i can commit to this . <eou> Have you ever thought about getting an au pair ? Au pair is a nanny / helper from a different country who will live with you and could help you with your son and other stuff <eou> We had one , but my wife hated her . I thought she was great . My wife said the au pair had to go or she was . I think i made the wrong choice . Maybe i will enroll my son in Karate classes . That is only one hour a week . <eou> Maybe instead of au pair you could find a nanny . She could take him to karate or boy scouts events and provide a child care <eou> 	Yes , you are right . I am going to look for a " girlfriend " to be a nanny for my son . I believe he will like that , and I will too .

I love to read - it ' s such a great escape - do you ? <eou> I completely agree . Reading is such a fun , enjoyable thing to do . It also is nice in that it helps share information and ideas . This will help progress our society so that we can learn from our mistakes .

It helps inspire people . Many libraries are classifying it in it ' s own genre .. <eou> Yes a few of them as well . Karen Kingsbury is probably my favorite author of that genre . <eou> Her first book " Missy ' s Murder " is a favorite of mine . I can ' t believe that it was written all the way back in 1991 . Do you know about the murder story that it was based on ? <eou> I don ' t think I ' ve read that one as our library leaves a bit to be desired in this area . <eou> Ahh you should defintely check for it . Libraries should provide a place for creativity and analyzing things critically .

Have you had someone close to you with cancer ? <eou> Yes , unfortunately . I had a friend in middle school who passed away from Brain Cancer . She had some unexplained weight loss and collapsed at school before being diagnosed . Have you ? <eou> My grandmother died from lung cancer when I was a teen . So many different types of cancer , right ? <eou> Yes there are over 100 types . Unfortunately for my friend , hers wasn ' t really caused by anything she did . Was your grandmother a tobacco user ? <eou> Yes , she was . Smoked for years even though she was a nurse . I think its more scary when you dont have a trigger . <eou> Definitely more scary . Tobacco is no joke though . It causes 22 % of cancer deaths and is responsible for 85 % of lung cancer . I hope you do not smoke ! <eou> Absolutely not ! Not after seeing her decline . <eou> I am glad to hear that :) I think the next biggest causes of cancer are obesity , infections , radiation and environmental pollutants . <eou> Environmental , like power lines and polluted water ? <eou> 	I think air pollution is the biggest risk with environment pollutants . In America , around 60 % of people live in areas where air pollution has reached unhealthy levels , but it has been getting better over the last decade .	close cancer <eou> unexplained diagnosed passed friend school collapsed middle loss unfortunately weight <eou> lung types teen grandmother died cancer <eou> tobacco friend 100 user types grandmother hers caused <eou> nurse trigger dont scary <eou> lung 85 22 hope smoke cancer scary responsible joke deaths causes <eou> decline seeing <eou> radiation infections pollutants hear am obesity cancer biggest glad environmental causes <eou> lines water power polluted <eou>  <expand> person disease smoke like cigarette light bad medicine ceritinib oma death nintedanib smoking bear entolimod carcinogen kill c cell cancer spread cause good school need body us part burn being legal music double street relative equal weather lucatumumab malignity spongiatriol lintuzumab downstaging precancer plerixafor cardiooncology epiregulin niraparib oncomodulator trofosfamide lichen photoaging genotoxin onapristone omacetaxine ganitumab pseudocirrhosis psychooncology cancerwort floxuridine ixazomib cancriform andrographolide proliferation farletuzumab cancerette anticancer bevacizumab alanosine taxane virotherapy noncancer immunoediting nilotinib eflornithine astrology hemangiosarcoma carcinomatophobia cyclophosphamide rucaparib tiazofurin cancerized amatuximab cancerize palbociclib mafosfamide leukemia ertumaxomab mucositis carcinostatic laulimalide tenatumomab zeniplatin oncomir oligometastasis cantuzumab carcinology abexinostat immunotherapy malignin dacetuzumab bosatinib capecitabine lexatumumab onartuzumab oncolytic oncofetal calicheamicin neurosarcoma melanoma amonafide carcinogenetic condurango necitumumab drozitumab conatumumab chemocentric malignancy bavituximab tissue gigantol oblimersen malignant mesna salvestrol cancerphobic entinostat nilutamide porocarcinoma carbestrol flox dihydrotestosterone antigonadotropin saracatinib carcino tumor immunocytokine oncopharmacology etoposide pteroylaspartic neopeltolide deoxydoxorubicin nofetumomab catumaxomab angiomodulin cocarcinogen zalutumumab oncoretrovirus carcinogenesis subcarcinogenic bicalutamide mole essiac fosfestrol anticarcinogen metastasis animal carcinogenic amifostine cancerology staging sunburn microcalcification obatoclax cancerologist tyrindoleninone cancri neosis osteosarcoma leucovorin oncomouse lynx lymphoma lump iniparib erlotinib oncomodulation multimetastasis cancerogenesis choriocarcinoma oncofertility pemtumomab tioguanine oncogenotype hepatocarcinoma mitotane thyrosphere zodiac apolizumab mapatumumab mercaptopurine lymphadenectomy anticolorectal cancericidal onconeural onconeuronal capricorn aflibercept cancerian ranimustine oncovirus immunokinase mannosulfan nonmelanoma atiprimod lexidronam neratinib pericancerous drostanolone precancerous anhydrovinblastine oncotype oncotarget abiraterone lonidamine gefitinib marimastat carcinolytic oncostatic cisplatin epigenotoxic oncogenetics fresolimumab genotoxic scintimammography solanoid krebiozen myrtucommulone canceration oncotripsy oregovomab cancered carcinophobia oncogenomics satumomab oncoinflammation cancerization triciribine carcinoma prostasphere incarcerate esthesioneuroblastoma growth selumetinib ensituximab chondrosarcoma oncometabolite upstage detumomab bosutinib cancerously sorafenib tumorigenically canertinib constellation nonseminoma chancre altumomab oncology chromothripsis edotreotide enzalutamide degarelix mormal astrocytoma troxacitabine chemoradiotherapy tumoroid multicancer antiangiogenic pathotropic sipuleucel pritumumab osteocarcinoma photocarcinogenesis oncoapoptosis cancerostatic nimotuzumab lenvatinib edrecolomab jaborosalactol taplitumomab hepatoma cancers imatinib cetrorelix biricodar chlorotrianisene lasofoxifene illness imexon farnesyltransferase capricornus neuroblastoma igovomab fluoropyrimidine motesanib crab oncomodulatory streptozotocin isotretinoin

Man , can Danny Carey play those drums , he makes the band come alive sometimes .

It used to be an Olympic sport . During a 1924 race in a Paris heat wave , 8 runners were taken away on a stretcher . I hope that ' s not me . <eou> 	Wow , that would be really unfortunate .

Hard to believe , but I have a soft spot for heavy metal sometimes ! I know critics often dislike it despite a LARGE fan base , but sometimes ya gotta bang your head <eou> I used to thoroughly enjoy heavy metal when i was younger during my teenage years ! Who are some of the best heavy metal bands ? <eou> Well we could go old school and nostalgic with 3 of the biggest + baddest : Led Zepellin , Black Sabbath , and Deep Purple ! Did you have a favorite ? <eou> I ' ve heard of all of them except deep purple . Black sabbath is the one with ozzy osbourne right ? I can ' t remember the band i used to listen to but i had the whole album on repeat ! What else do you know about heavy metal ? <eou> Yes to Black Sabbath and Ozzy . Like lots of genres , it ' s seen its share of offshoots and evolution -- like the 80s " glam metal " movement with groups like Motley Crue and Poison ! <eou> Oh wow , i can definitely appreciate the culture of heavy metal ! It was Bullet For My Valentine ! they were so good back in the day . Do you know when heavy metal started ? <eou> Late 60s and early 70s , largely in the UK , interestingly . For some reason , it seems very American to me . <eou> That ' s interesting , so it came out by the end of the hippy era ? I have a friend in a heavy metal band i do like the music its very different . What else can you tell me about heavy metal ? <eou> Interestingly , its roots are in blues rock and psychedelica -- so right in line with the time it was born . Of course it ' s got a MUCH bigger , massive sound . AND LOUD ! <eou> 	That ' s cool ! the environment had an impact in music back then which is very interesting as well .

For some reason I never think of Canada as a basketball country . <eou> Yes they struggled in the early years but they won a total of 101 games but lost 359 <eou> That ' s a terrible record ! Why on earth did your friend support them ? It ' s like my husband supporting the Miami Dolphins , even though they are useless ( he ' s from Miami ). <eou> Who knows why anyone support these losing teams ? At least the Dolphins are Floridas oldest professional sports team , I guess that could be a reason to support them . <eou> True enough . It must be soul destroying , losing week after week .

Even though I personally don ' t really believe in God , the whole prospect of God and religion has always been sort of interesting . <eou> It is very interesting . I share the same thought about God as you . What do you find most interesting ? <eou> One part that is interesting is that older civilizations used God ( s ) to explain certain natural processes , like the Sun rising . <eou> Does that come from people needing to explain the unexplained ? <eou> Pretty much , unexplained things scare people so they need to explain them to put themselves at ease . Especially back then with limited scientific knowledge . <eou> Do you know what made people start believing in only one god ? <eou> I believe that much of it is due to the rise of Christianity , which is the most popular monotheistic religion ever and still is . <eou> You know a lot about this subject .

Killer whales are considered dolphins , and they feed on fish , seals , and ... wait for it ... DOLPHINS ! <eou> I can see how they would be in the dolphin family .

Jamaica is an awesome island country <eou> And it ' s also home to Bob Marley . One of the greatest musicians of all time . <eou> Bob Marley was one of the best singers to exist and also really helped push weed as something that is not a problem <eou> For that I am also very grateful . Cannabis is a blessing to many people with many otherwise untreatable ailments . <eou> Medical cannabis is such an important tool , its nice that it is becoming something people dont think is bad anymore <eou> From sea to shining sea it ' s becoming legalized . Hopefully now there will be meaningful research into it ' s benefits . <eou> Jamaica even has it legalized due to Marleys influence , what a great island country <eou> Jamaica has some amazing runners . It ' s incredible how seemingly out of no where they became a nation with some of the best runners in the world . <eou> Yep , Usain bolt is from the country Jamaica and he is probably the best runner to ever live <eou> 	I was just watching Usain Bolt race Kevin Hart across a basketball court in a dribbling contest .

I have three small dogs ! They ' re adorable . <eou> They ' re may be the best pet ! They were the very first species to be domesticated , as well . Since then , they ' ve been selectively bred for more than a millennia ! This has been done to achieve certain behaviors , sensory capabilities , and physical attributes , of course . <eou> Wow really ? I just bought mine from the breeder and didn ' t think too much about where they came from . <eou> You choosing dogs as pets is wise . Dogs being associated with humans has encouraged them to become uniquely attuned to human behavior , which has led them to be so much more better suited to co - exist and be pets with humans over other canid species . <eou> Yes , mine always seem to know when I am getting sick and they spend time with me . <eou> I ' m glad to hear it . But of course affection isn ' t the only role they play . The serve in hunting , herding , pulling loads , protection , assisting police / military , and also helping those who are handicapped or who need therapy ! <eou> Mine are only small , so I don ' t know how much policing they will be doing . But I always wanted a big German Shepard . <eou> 	Haha , understood . And yes , German Shepherds are highly popular , as well . On another note , interestingly , new research has found that dogs have mutations to equivalent genetic regions in humans , where changes are known to increase sociability and lower intelligence !	adorable dogs re <eou> capabilities re selectively sensory species course pet domesticated achieve physical millennia attributes ve behaviors bred <eou> breeder bought mine <eou> suited choosing co humans exist human dogs associated wise uniquely species pets encouraged canid attuned behavior led <eou> time sick am getting mine spend <eou> loads glad affection police military handicapped isn pulling hunting herding play therapy course assisting protection serve helping hear role <eou> policing don doing <eou>  <expand> run dog slang class work play do human park sleep music type place action person animal touch game people move being fox dogs laugh nautical pet fur cat house attack us owner race unit lead train plate time property pass activity act learning show reward sound medicine miner habit fish kind boy chicken dialing horse generic university ship round cover dinner leg field home dance taste force exercise energy waste adjective gather birthday pick like art doctor servant function see bear bones reproduce hatch racing bone flea mean friendly about out receive are a record organ ear pain feel biology nativity order cow special man sex family courser knowledge science running portion closer feeling drop line facility hunt geography division bed crisis school location event playing term land remove current blood fine rough meal plan general company hit mineral fight personal walk cast break heat computing mining psychology nothing desert military weapon skin learn cry age die talk mine money good care trouble use down stale set beat joy double rest camp legal help evil clip wolf grow neuter feet tail mate eat toys grooming happy houses ears pets teeth stick hear finite reply apple new away rs return gain again production repeat represent eye smell sport nullomer parrot ruff paleoethology omnicide monoassociated ciguatera heikegani pheromone native diagnosis invasive multiregionalism genetics poliovirus range monogenism lion ruffle population matriotism lady lovebird hobby uniform amphixenosis bastardization archipallium alien ginger postgenderism tea bestiality workshop history long river direction channel soup horses section certificate rake part golf timecourse hours study track name stage played departure beginning drift sequence slope setting way fairway runner trail cost canal related semester first traverse love canary bird dear rule rabbit fail harvest vehicle get swim wound handicap sign body disease health bend dead exist mountain power attribute quality

I wonder if there is an effective method of preventing snakes from entering . <eou> I always try to make sure in the spring that there isn ' t a food source for rodents in the summer .

Hi . I ' m thinking about getting the botulinum injections and would love to know more about them . <eou> Botulinum is a toxin produced by the bacteria Clostridium Botulinum . <eou> Sounds a little scary , but I know people that have had it done and really like the results . <eou> It can be used for therapeutic purposes . The first such use was to treat strabismus in 1981 . <eou> Oh wow , really ? Is strabismus the weak eye thing ? <eou> Yes . Botulinum works by blocking neural impulses from muscles , and so causes muscle paralysis . This can be helpful in conditions where muscles are overactive . <eou> That sounds really interesting . What about restless leg syndrome ? Can it help with that ? <eou> Yes . Botulinum can relieve the uncomfortable sensations from RLS . <eou> That ' s really cool . I didn ' t know that the botulinum toxin had so many uses . Thanks ! <eou> 	It can be used to treat a number of problems related to muscle spasms and diseases that are associated with overactive muscle .	botulinum getting thinking love injections <eou> toxin bacteria produced <eou> little people results scary <eou> therapeutic purposes strabismus treat <eou> weak strabismus wow eye <eou> impulses helpful muscle overactive paralysis conditions muscles blocking causes neural <eou> restless leg sounds help syndrome <eou> relieve sensations uncomfortable <eou> toxin cool botulinum <eou>  <expand> human disease botox people botulism rest like dog body hand muscle toxin botulin help arm cry stretch drink animals good uk pain two big bed animal single slang servant shade test bone us party person remedy strabismus bacterium move doctor dance exercise reading everyone giving walk wedding bar employ marry chicken work need gym being head logic baby kiss child blind special kind you strong care doll heart pet chick enterotoxin staphylotoxin pyocyanine toxidrome poison kreotoxin biodefense mangotoxin aerolysin tetanolysin rod small heat less low little tally quiet cut cold trick ring surprise stage better laugh member pair machine game humans man nervous focus walleye squint exotropia eye cyclophoria vision cyclotropia tropia hypertropia hypotropia esotropia use condition ability strength limp part aid organ limb support computing anxious relief nonbotulinum anaerobic botulinic botulinus pull money arise trouble irritation transport progress enjoy dress buy profit soap beg evening climb call bank joy agree ask birthday gather interview shower peace degree squirrel charity action trade reduce connect smile pay headaches age get conscience philosophy brains thinking discourse forehead entertainment temperament idea fun memory brain creative remembering working speculation hope intelligent learning coding thoughtful fatigue plan think emotional passionate home lie happy emotions forgive toy attachment sex great feelings chocolate admiration object date love gentle caring silk affair family someone marriage hurt fresh leave much worship life lots benevolent lovelight living psyche war material neighbour sing needle pyrotoxin toxinlike syntoxoid cobratoxin maitotoxin immunotoxin splenotoxin zymocin kurtoxin endotoxin poisonous imperatoxin zootoxin fasciculin hepatotoxin hefutoxin parasporal mydatoxin verocytotoxin hanatoxin phototoxin cicutoxin actinotoxin pneumotoxin hadrucalcin virotoxin abrin toxidermia necrotoxin toxiferine bibrotoxin chemotoxin ophanin daphnin cevanine endotheliotoxin bacteriocin neurotoxin genotoxin wedeloside sarafotoxin scyllatoxin chlorotoxin tolevamer toxinosis xanthotoxin botulinal ecotoxicogenomics charybdotoxin urotoxin mandaratoxin aflatoxin mastoparan pathotoxin hematotoxin lipotoxin lyngbyatoxin cercosporin cytotoxin anatoxin toxoid dendrotoxin ototoxicity virstatin philanthotoxin cephalotoxin gliotoxin

So I have a phobia of the dark . I ' ve had it since I was a kid . Apparently it ' s pretty common , at least that ' s what my parents told me ! <eou> From what I know , it is one of the more common ones . I imagine it ' s triggered by something , like a scary movie . Do you know anything about yours ? <eou> I ' ve always been more scared of imagined dangers that could be there , and not as much as the darkness itself . <eou> My cousin got his fear after watching ' It ' with the clown . I imagine it ' s similar with you where you got scared at some point and never grew out of it <eou> For me it wasn ' t so much a movie , but just a general fear . I heard it ' s pretty natural for kids to some degree . It can be a phase ... but I ' m still scared , so I guess not haha <eou> Well I ' m not an expert so I suppose I don ' t have the exact answer lol <eou> Yeah I don ' t know either . The researchers Sigmund Freud said it was a manifestation of separation anxiety .

I am color blind . I have a decreased ability to see differences in color . <eou> Oh wow ... are you completely colorblind or is it a specific type ? <eou> Not completely , no . I can still see colors , I just have difficulty with specific colors , like telling the difference between red and green . <eou> Ahh I see . So what is that like ? Is there a way to fix it ? I have heard that there are special glasses you can wear that will help . <eou> So there isn ' t a cure , but since I was diagnosed with this disorder , I went to a specialist who taught me certain methods of coping . <eou> Ahhh . What kind of methods do you use ? Which ones work best ? <eou> Just learning to adapt ! Like , for example little things that people take for granted , like telling the difference between stop red and green stop lights . <eou> Interesting ! My wife is actually colorblind as well , but she has trouble seeing yellow and green . Yellow is pink , and green is blue . <eou> Wow that ' s weird ! I am a woman too , so it ' s weird to hear about when other women are color blind . Being color blind is more common in males , because females have two X chromosomes , and the defect for color blindness is usually on just one X chromosome so the other compensates . <eou> 	Wow !

I guess I ' m not the only one who loves the city ! <eou> That ' s pretty nice .. I would never have guessed that , but maybe it makes sense in terms of cost of living , etc .

I ' ve been to a fairly large number of museums in my life . Some of my favorites are ones that have scientific artifacts . Have you been to any good ones ? <eou> My favorite one in my memories is the Science Museum in San Francisco called California Academy of Science ! It was the most gorgeous place I ' ve ever been in ! What was your favorite museum ? <eou> Probably the Smithsonian Natural History Museum in Washington DC . It has a lot of biological history in it , and I love looking at things about animals . <eou> When you say biological history , what does that entail ? Forgive me as I am not experienced on the topic of biology . <eou> Oh , just history mixed with any kind of biology . For instance , history of the development of types of animals , like evolutionary history and things like that . This can branch out into biophysics history , molecular biology , that kind of thing . <eou> Oh that ' d be so interesting to go to ! The California Academy of Science has less of that kind of history , but they literally have a dome of ecosystem filled with birds , snakes , alligators , and fish . The best part is you can go below that dome and even inside the dome ! There is also a fossil exhibit as well ! <eou> That sounds so awesome ! It ' s always been a really cool thought to see inside the habitat of reptiles , like turtles and snakes and things , without bothering them . I want to go there ! <eou> 	Yes ! If you ever go to San Francisco PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE go ! Its one of the best experiences of my life and I still go there when I visit San Francisco as a 22 year old who acts like a 9 year old LOL	museums artifacts favorites scientific ones life fairly ve <eou> memories gorgeous museum called ve favorite <eou> biological lot love animals looking history <eou> biological am biology experienced topic entail history <eou> instance development molecular branch biology types biophysics animals evolutionary mixed history <eou> literally filled fossil ecosystem snakes inside birds dome below fish alligators exhibit history <eou> habitat bothering cool sounds reptiles snakes turtles inside awesome <eou>  <expand> nature biology school museum art science life plant cell like animal research old people nest recapitulationism class home study animals drink chemistry subject computing ecological age experience past time living cotton fate history bone eye nerve area reproduce kind british ark native cormogeny medicine math has physiogeny organology organophyly studying account present phylogeny book egg head matter atom fact culture psychohistory grow being water fish existence evolution news organism milestone important period bio object biography reproduction blood world fair epicene historical beaver name photobiophysics big wet organic cytofluorogram natural biomodel biomodelling centesimation century bank library lovelore chick war food zoo bird zoology long thematic mammoth anthrohistory byzantine colony geomorphology accounting boring mirrortree pass nonscience country reptile case artifact lead card family creature stadium person around perfect bones wax bioplasma membranotropic bioirrigation biocuration biophysiology electrobiology bioanalyzer biologic biosystem transduction biovector chronobiology bioproductivity abiological radiomimetic antibiological biorhythm interactome cytobiological biobank photobiology bioresponse biospecific biorepository microcinematography bioresearch bioimaging trunk biostudies auxesis biosex mechanobiology hebbosome biocycle biobanking photostimulation glycobiology cryosection bioclimate diaphanization cryoprotect bioassembly bioheat biofunction omics topobiology biofunctionalization chemobiology inhibitor phenology cryobiological biomodulator biophoton biologically biostatistics pathobiology biomapping biosimulation biostudy biofunctionalized bionanomaterial biopathology biorecognition biomathematics hexon biomembrane bioindicator psychobiology minislice biodistribution aerobiology biodosimetry biomineralize parent photoheterotrophy circadian biocontrol nanobiophotonics biocenology biosocial biospecies metallobiology histography photoresponse biogeochemistry protobiology rheostasis bioelectromagnetics biotest biocalorimetry scotobiology biologize biosignal histoarchitecture bionanosystem biogeodynamics bit park house field divide pet faunistic band territorial nocturnal tail eat limnobiology cloud tooth farm antiquity necrology bunk japanology hetman transhistoricity blistery writings asturia chronostratigraphy weimar bluecoat relegate lawspeaker censitary toomooroo memoir omphalos religiohistorical historify cerealia danelaw negationism classics twistorian recital stromatology passed onomatologist tonkin abelite transhistorical mythology meletian classes graphosphere motherless broadsword abelonian epoch proprietor reconquista estovers hongweibing future palestinianism scarlett ago neocosmic happenings saigonese conspiracism historiosophy proletariat historyless adderall trireme medical emeritum tacitus

Hi . We just started alternating shift work where I work . I think I like it . <eou> I quite like it too .

I like the variety so you don ' t get bored with one way of working . <eou> That ' s definitely one reason . It ' s called this because it divides the day into shifts and different groups of workers work these shifts . <eou> It is kind of hard to get used to staying up all night but I get used to it after a while <eou> Agreed , the whole 24 hour thing can get you some really bad shifts . <eou> You either love or you hate it , I ' ve found <eou> Most people who seem to hate it are those who have families or are married or in a relationship , since shift work can strain these relationships . <eou> Yes , because if you have to sleep during the day , it can be hard on the one who doesn ' t have to . <eou> 	Shift work also causes risk to develop many disorders , so it really has a risk with it /	started shift alternating <eou> basically practice hours 24 designed day <eou> variety don bored <eou> reason divides workers called day definitely shifts <eou> hard staying night <eou> 24 hour bad shifts <eou> love hate ve found <eou> relationships people relationship strain hate married families shift <eou> hard day sleep doesn <eou>  <expand> morning work hours office love day time care like late night dream nighttime age date common birthday life good bed affair dissolve workday slang early substitute tabulatable vulgar us habit minute measure hour rest baby sunset news labour noon part tree apple evening shade midnight born twilight bone being feeling home evil war trick function shifter baseball phonetics go gang cycle mathematics science routine makes effort exercise live manner daytime morrow christmas unit brightness daymeal nones loveday dusk equidiurnal daylight daydream nice noctidial nigh four timeband diurnation birth occasion tellurion daysleeper measurement period sunshine tonight thirty chocolate length second diel interval nightfall span blue twelve days photoperiodism segment nychthemeron sunrise event nictemeral bid every spend nightingale earth afternoon twenty ordinary present weather year deciday kind father humans child find ground emotion memory stale deep living book camp party lie poison wedding marry family marriage change move type fault relief call hurry watch shark slip computing behaviour action fast intelligence arts hardsport perfect test sing clock shift hardwired daypack sunlight equinox elect everyday lily dayward halloween diary daysack tridaily element tenday hackday daybook omer pridian packyear calends tuesday dies david étape dpo independence dayboy dayson qid eid on terdiurnal astronomy yestersol daybeam solar quadragesimal whitsuntide interday centiday aft ephemeral daypart qingming nundine monday daytrip washday latter deyes instant quintan deathday senshuraku independent sunlit solstice someday has section bfod triduanly scorcher daysailor daycoach hebdomad matchday daycation arbor daily nanosecond rescue sabbath mensiversary daygirl schoolday reckoning bissextile holiday month calendar gray multiday exeligmos daylife darg non court contention lifeday lunation chronomancy sunburn daysail daybed tosol datebook hebdomadally weekday yearday week mice wednesday dayroom highday dayslong metemptosis novendial hometime language intraday sunny midday clear dayes daybreak schooldays era flag triduan shorter daycarer lunch prorate dayshield dayspring daycare daymark calender lightmans kathina journeyman wakey bidaily

I love dancing and have been a ballroom dancer since I was little . It ' s a nice set of partner dances but can be very competitive . <eou> That ' s awesome !

It ' s nice when you go into adolescence with passion for dancing . This way since teenage years you can continue with a child passion into adulthood . <eou> Will you teach it to your children some day ? <eou> I might because it can be good for a child development , it is a biological , psychological and emotional process of changes in the early life of a child until adolescence . Activity like dancing could be good for it . <eou> Yes , I bet they would probably learn the steps faster than most adults too ! <eou> That ' s true , even though the process of development is unique for every child . <eou> 	Yes , I wish I had learned this when I was younger .

Hi . I am terrified of snakes . <eou> Given they ' re found on every continent except Antarctica , I know that ' s a lot to be terrified of ! <eou> Yes , lol . We live in a mountain community , so they are everywhere . Luckily we have one had one on our drive way a few years ago . <eou> Does it help if you think of them as " legless lizards " ;-) Or are you not crazy about reptiles in general ? <eou> I never thought of that lol , but no I am not really a reptile person . <eou> I know I ' m likely the minority , but I ' m actually fascinated with snakes . Some are actually super helpful in terms of pest control . The trick , of course , is * knowing * the good from the poisonous in time to react ! <eou> That is what my husband keeps telling me , that they eat the scorpions around . <eou> Now scorpions ..... THEY give me the willies ! I can never get over how * thin * their little bodies can squash down to . And I know people who have had them drop out of overhead light fixtures ! <eou> The ones hear are pretty tiny , but when we lived in Florida we saw pretty big ones that would creep me out ! <eou> 	Those and * centipedes * are just < shudder !> So with all that pest talk , are you considering a house snake now ?!

Do you have any tattoos ? I personally am never getting one , it just seems like a terrible decision to me <eou> No my dad is covered so as I got older I choose not to insert ink , dyes and pigments , either indelible or temporary , into the dermis layer of the skin <eou> That is good , although my opinion is not the end all be all , I just do not get it , I change my wallpaper every week on my phone , I dislike something so permanent <eou> Tattoos fall into three broad categories , decorative , symbolic and pictorial . I like the ideal of Symbolic which sounds nice until you realize it will remind you of that person that passed or even your entire life . Maybe you should get a foot tattoo ? <eou> Yeah I do like symbolic ones , I just feel there are better ways to remember people than a bad decision like that , which could make you get passed up for jobs <eou> Yea , I work a white collar job and we will not even hire anyone with tattoos . It ' s only been the last 100 years the fashion tattoos have been in fashion . Who ' s to say what people will think of them in another 100 . <eou> Yeah our culture changes so much , and I sort of get the whole business thing , because it is sort of a bad choice , and it shows a potential , not definite , lack of decision making <eou> I ' ve heard tattooing is very old but the word " tattoo ", or " tattow " did not come around until the 18th century . I wonder what they called them before that . <eou> I am not sure , it must have been an odd cultural thing I suppose ! <eou> 	Prior to the word being invented Tattoo ' s were just referred to as painting , scarring , or staining but had no official name .

Remember that band Creed ? They formed in 1993 from Tallahassee , Florida . <eou> Yes I love some of their songs , especially with arms wide open and one last breath <eou> Yeah with arms wide open came out in 2000 , off their album Human Clay . I think it is there most popular song , it centainly spawned a lot of internet memes . <eou> Are they still going strong or have they separated by now ? <eou> They disbanded in 2004 due to tension between the members . <eou> Pity . Im sure they would have been a good band to watch live . The last band I watched live was Chilli peppers , they were good . What about you ? <eou> Oh I ' m a big fan of the Red Hot Chili Peppers , Stadium Arcadium is my favorite album . They are from Los Angeles <eou> Are they ? They did a big outdoor gig where I live and it was fantastic to watch .

I am a new kindergarten teacher . I think kindergarten is an important grade for kids . <eou> Kindergarten is good for playing , singing , drawing , and social interaction . <eou> Did you attend kindergarten as a kid ? What do you remember about it ? <eou> I remember the alphabet people and getting to take them home . My favorite was Mr . M with the munchy mouth . <eou> Did you use alphabet queue cards ?

Cosmetics are products which people use to enhance / alter the appearance of their body . Do you use cosmetics ? <eou> I do . I try to be more natural with it though <eou> While many cosmetics are usually a mixture of chemical compounds , some are derived from natural sources , e . g . coconut oil . <eou> I generally try to go for the ones like that because I have really sensitive skin . <eou> Cosmetics are regulated by the FDA in the US . They define cosmetics as applying to the body without affecting the body ' s functions . So I guess most natural cosmetics are the best . <eou> I also prefer the more natural look . with lighter shades <eou> I do too . Too much makeup looks unpleasant to me . <eou> you definetly dont want to overdo it <eou> No you don ' t .

I always felt that being a vegetarian was the right thing to do . <eou> Do you feel that way because of sentient life ? <eou> I always felt that going out of our way to kill other mammals that god put on this planet was something he would not approve of . I also believe being raised religious contributed to this . <eou> That ' s true .

What are your thoughts toward vegetarianism <eou> I can see its merits . How do you feel about abstaining from all animal products ? <eou> I feel like thats impossible due to our heavy reliance on those products . If we have alternatives that were affordable that would be a different thing but that is a tradeoff that I can ' t afford <eou> Indeed . There are animal ingredients even in things like processed foods and candy <eou> Yea . I always found it weird when I found out there were cows involved in marsh - mellows so imagine the other foods that animal ingredients are used in .

Hi , how are you ? Something interesting about me is my father is a preacher . <eou> I love listening to our preacher ' s sermons on Sundays .

Do you listen to your preacher every Sunday ? <eou> Yes , it ' s part of our Sunday family time and is definitely a very important part of our day . <eou> Same for our family . My dad actually spends a lot of time the whole week preparing for Sunday sermon . <eou> I guess that adds a whole new dimension to Father ' s Day , celebrating fatherhood but also his influence in society . <eou> That ' s true .

On a cold day , I love to drink a nice Cappuccino . The combo of espresso and milk is amazing ! <eou> Oh , I so agree . I love coffee of all kind . But cappuccino is lovely <eou> Do you like yours with cream or milk ? <eou> I always prefer cream . I actually don ' t like the taste of milk . Odd , I know <eou> That is a little odd but cream has a higher saturated fat content so it makes it taste better than milk . <eou> I guess that ' s why . I had a milk allergy as a child and it ' s influenced me to this day . <eou> Oh that ' s not good . I know different types of plant milk are popular these days .

I love dogs . In fact , I have three of them . Dogs were domesticated before any other animal and have been selectively bred ever since . <eou> Wow this is so interesting , I wonder how they might have been before domestication <eou> It ' s not clear , though the gray wolf is the dog ' s closest living relative . <eou> How far back does can one trace the history of man living with dogs ? <eou> Depends on who you ask .

I ' ve got a bunch of friends who are in their 30 ' s who are still into skateboarding . It ' s kind of cool , because it ' s not only a form of transportation , but it ' s an art form , and exercise , and it can even be a job . <eou> I think it ' s dangerous as form of transportation . Someone could easily get hurt . <eou> You just have to wear a helmet ! Pads , if you ' re really nervous . There are , after all , about 11 million skateboarders in the world .

Plus , there are skateparks , places specifically designed for skateboarders to practice and work on their tricks .

As a bigger guy I ' m really trying to live on a restricted diet with a combination with physical exercise , to reduce body weight .

Each morning I have a diet protein shake with a bananna <eou> I wish I was like my father who has to follow a special diet to gain and keep on weight . <eou> Tell me about it . My middle daughter is the same way . She is like her father , definitely not me . But I lost weight with my morning shake plus 1 meal a deal before . <eou> I tried the shakes but I ' m still hungry after . In general , the most effective diet is any which reduces calorie ' s in so now I ' m a calorie counter . <eou> Try another kind . There are so many . Add a banana , chia seed and flax seed . The seeds are tasteless and they bulk up the water to fill you up . I drink water and diet green tea all day too . <eou> Thanks for the tip . I did stop drinking any soft drink and now only drink water and Green tea . I love it and it ' s roots dating back to China . <eou> Yes it ' s awesome stuff !

I don ' t know what I ' ve been missing by not eating steak sooner in my life . I love that there are so many different kinds of cuts of steak to enjoy , too ! Skirt steak , flank steak , silverfinger steak .. I have much to catch up on . <eou> Can you tell me more about how to cook steak ? <eou> It ' s a big process of discovering how you like it , and what ' s easiest for you . Generally , it ' s grilled because people want to replicate the certain flavor that comes about when it ' s cooked over the coals of an open fire . But you have other options , like cooking it in sauce ( e . g . in a steak and kidney pie ), or putting it into patties for hamburgers . Up to the user ! <eou> Is steak limited to just beef or is there such a thing as chicken steak and stuff like that ?/ <eou> The word usually refers to beefsteak ; but absolutely , yes , there can be other kinds , like fish steak , or steak from bison , camel , goat , kangaroo , ostrich , reindeer , zebu , horse ... and the list goes on . It ' s kind of a catch - all term . <eou> Interesting , let ' s discuss a different food idea , like eggs for instance . How do you like to prepare your eggs ? <eou> Me personally ? I ' m a poached egg kind of guy . I like eggs cooked outside of the shell by it being poached / steamed , so that it ' s more delicately cooked . I love them just as much as I love steak because of the protein they provide , which is great for your diet . <eou> Sorry I meant food item not food idea . I ' ve never tried poached eggs , I ' m more a hard - boiled person , but it seems like a novel cooking method . <eou> Give it a shot ! It ' s easy , but you have to be precise and paying attention . Mainly you ' re cracking an egg into a cup / bowl , then sliding that into a pan of water that ' s heated to 75 degrees celsius , cooking it until the egg white is mostly solid but with a soft yolk -- that ' s key . You want a runny yolk with a slightly hardened crust , but no raw white . <eou> 	Sounds like a detailed process , but I ' ll give it a shot , thanks for informing me about it .	enjoy cuts catch kinds eating love don missing life ve steak flank sooner <eou> tell steak cook <eou> options cooking hamburgers process sauce fire comes pie grilled discovering people replicate flavor cooked easiest coals putting user patties kidney steak <eou> limited beef stuff chicken steak <eou> reindeer horse goes beefsteak ostrich word steak refers catch yes usually kangaroo fish zebu camel list kinds bison absolutely term goat <eou> discuss eggs instance food idea prepare <eou> delicately eggs guy outside cooked love poached personally protein diet provide shell steak egg steamed <eou> eggs boiled hard food person novel idea poached meant tried item ve cooking method <eou> water key precise shot easy raw celsius bowl 75 paying egg cup soft solid degrees crust heated runny cracking hardened yolk pan re white slightly attention sliding cooking <eou>  <expand> food slang plate chicken egg cooking eating bread person fish good animal cake pot cook rice steak meat oven beef dinner water edible bone eat object chick cow bird cut music computing soup drink home sauce salt like fire stew meal big fresh rib freezer fillet steam heat can shell board table duck apple eaten cooked yolk red preserve potatoes grill broil action oil kitchen bullet container pain toy kind dish roll living seed chop being child plant rare flesh tough servant burn butter us house mammal nest play have party blood historical drop game lobster rabbit substance taste fruit gas order life hunger uk dog heart dress lay hard art thick rub rouelle slice nice nautical side deglaze stove boil curry bishop toast season liquid color wood cover tin paste glass metal eggs sing crop slip hook round fast pie cat sheep baby birds british bed care head prime porterhouse base chuck mark garlic camp liquor quenelle spatula beat process produce work man snow air item fridge stale supermarket poison body milk poached thing scale paper hen noodle white form eye roe vessel albumin feeling paint boat ball get marry listen hand corn chocolate spoon berry birthday quail restaurant bean feed steakhouse pickle two letter dear doll philosophy pet people live science biology energy steakfish cows sirloin steaks entrecôte beefsteak monkeygland generally chipsteak delicious concoct captain make fry making preparation brown olive lard machine prepare frost parmigiana mixer smoke stuff cream legal pizza has steel wax book refrigerator easy character need ground horse cast sugar grape farm female fried protein yoke whip sound rock crab blue inside love young time employ butcher school fisherman stop root hold watch change find bear napkin digestion mouth potato cuisine lie god dance price silk family value war material fellow creature desert news
I love comic books , especially Marvel comics . Are you familiar with comics ? <eou> I ' ve always wanted to read them but there just seem to be so many to choose from ! <eou> It ' s true , it can be overwhelming ! My advice is to focus on one of the major characters at first . My faves are Spider - man , Thor , and X - Men . <eou> Hey , I recognize those heroes . Comic books must have been popular for a really long time , huh ? <eou> Definitely ! Marvel started way back in 1939 as Timely Publications ; but the modern Marvel that we know today wasn ' t around til the 60s . <eou> I think I ' d have to say I like the name Marvel a lot better ! Do you know who one of the first Marvel heroes were they started making comics about ? <eou> Yeah , the Fantastic Four was one of the first big ones from the 60s . But most of the popular heroes , like Iron Man and Spider - man also showed up around that time . <eou> I ' ll definitely have to check some out . Is it best to start at the beginning of a series ? <eou> A lot of the older comics are boring to read nowadays . But they re - launch each comic every few years , so there ' s always a good jumping - on point . <eou> 	Well , I think you ' ve convinced me . Now I just have to decide whether to shop online or go into a local store .	familiar especially books love comic comics <eou> ve choose read <eou> focus overwhelming true faves major characters advice <eou> time books popular heroes huh recognize <eou> 60s til modern started <eou> started lot heroes comics name <eou> time 60s popular heroes ones <eou> beginning start series ll check definitely <eou> re boring lot jumping comic nowadays comics read launch <eou>  <expand> story like history library school newspaper flash now adjective reading table being big manga music us first new word bed case print literature book beaver writing joy dance enjoy lots war comics marvel comicverse emanata komku webcomic manhwa sequence scanlation cartoon hero drawing determine number election action studying think pass magazine clock computing record beat light very place play space art once sports everything event century chicken start old home family unknown stale concession write opinion character written pages papers learn begin mystery letter title poetry fiction paper page due uk date british you people always day prize have mathematics out force draw past use rest relaxing passage clocks primer news admit line finish hobby step activity related break adjust glory slow main lord interval legal early time quantity class turn decimation dawn age property set current weather stop sith see work unit often period beginning change person single present crowd parcel demon understanding garden interpret known great animal companion knows well special extent university audit entertain important engaging office hogwarts college entertaining forever peace loved birthday dear someone leave much life precious trekverse slash marvelverse born nexus trekiverse batverse super storm watchmenverse smurf comix palestine webcartoonist cartoonist toon superfight manhua comic liefeldian superhero hench funnies hulk letterer a take answer best field knowledge review proofread understand do unread invalid recognise study significance consuming arread rede believe reply register consider contemplate eye bored call ignore crisis ground point real recognition accuracy rank relative shock bigtime offer long general experience adventure offset what debut again days term checkpoint prenominate go slang delay sleep era flies showtime hour continuum morning finite throw jerk watch crystal motion how checkout recent in game introduce money kuaiji none second late countdown evening contemporary before progression tail timely carol interest timing knickerbockers neomedieval king rap everyone

I ' ve never played the game Blackjack . Can you tell me anything about it ? <eou> Ah , the game also know as twenty - one ! Of course I can . So , usually there ' s several people and then a dealer . You all compete against the dealer , trying to beat him ! <eou> Blackjack <eou> Right , yeah . So if you ' re wondering how you beat the dealer , you get dealt two cards during the game , and so does the dealer . You then add up your hand and try to get as close to 21 without going over ! <eou> That ' s really cool ! So you are really just playing against the dealer and no one else ? <eou> Pretty much , yeah . And the cards have different values . You have the normal number cards , and the face cards are worth ten . Aces are either one or eleven . You can also draw additional cards . <eou> That ' s really cool !

Have you read any good horror fiction lately ? <eou> I have , actually ! I love horror fiction .. keeps me feeling invigorated . Just like historian J . A . Cuddon said , it ' s meant to " shock " or " frighten " you ... but he also said it ' s meant to induce a feeling of " repulsion or loathing ," which I ' ve never encountered . One of my favorite writers is Leigh Blackmore . <eou> I haven ' t read anything by Leigh Blackmore . What are some of Blackmore ' s books ? <eou> He ' s an Australian horror writer , even has a critic / editor role , and is a musician and occultist , funnily enough . One of his famous works is " Gaslight Grotesque ," which is kind of a horror spin on Sherlock Holmes . He was the Australian representative for the Horror Writers of America , so you know he ' s legit . <eou> Oh that ' s super cool ! I should try to pick up some of his books . Most people say Stephen King , but I don ' t particularly care for him . <eou> I like Stephen King because his works can be supernatural or non - supernatural . But I agree , sometimes I like horror fiction that kind of gets a little more metaphorical , and takes a spin on the larger fears of society . That truly allows for some artistic freedom . <eou> Well put ! Are there any other authors you like ? <eou> 	Oddly enough , what always seems to be a fun read is finding European horror fiction from way back , as in Ancient Greeks and Ancient Romans .. things like Greek mythology with Prometheus , who was a titan , etc .. They have an interesting way of writing and presenting their fears .	fiction lately read horror <eou> actually encountered frighten fiction repulsion loathing writers love feeling meant shock favorite induce ve invigorated historian horror <eou> haven read books <eou> spin funnily legit role writer representative critic musician famous editor occultist horror <eou> try cool books pick particularly people super care don <eou> takes fears freedom supernatural artistic fiction agree spin society truly allows little larger sometimes metaphorical horror <eou> authors <eou>  <expand> movie fiction person like surprise being emotion fear machenian literature shoggoth history reading legal splatterpunk story kingian cricket action book type amazement hatred dislike shock heaven calm people novel fantasy news writing have write dismay disgust anxiety terror revulsion thing awe intense shriek fright film good child dance condition office twist supervillain steampunk superhero books historical super horror god world take do paper school computing record scary cleaver dread abhorrence nervous panic lugosian detestation karloffian antipathy loathing films repugnance stuff aversion repulsive horrify physics pain great kind bed poetry mean title play cut slang ground transformer real science space bronzepunk fictioneer rest papers learn drive enjoy stall literal say table show believe written interpret pages print look page think understanding library dentist horrors horrifying horrorsome gore comedy chernukha consternation splatterday rascal bloodcurdling psychotronic splatstick suspense horrorzine bits terrorcore nonhorror abhor horrified horripilate horrifical scared craven deathrock shudder enhorrored horrour genre abomination demogorgon morbid elfmanesque ug horrorcore ravenloftian blochian agrise depression spoopy horrorfest horrent derlethian hagsploitation ecohorror aagh nightmare aghast awful evoke scream horrid splatter horripilation fellness recoil technohorror phobia shuddering horrow horrific horrification movies horrible horrendous horrormeister distressing horripilated right emotional baby home sex feelings human love care opinion hand better cold university word character room important author colony card hold servant name work band music art statue very duck novels superluminal weredonkey reality exposition autobiografiction robinsonade werepuma falsity weretroll magick fictions verisimilitude weregorilla werepanther fictional fictioneering suethor austerian microfiction weredingo wereghost ipcc wererabbit fictomercial weredog smallville comet pulp weremammoth subcharacter dystopia xenofiction werebeaver everywoman fictionmaking truth betelgeuse prose werecrab vulcan scientifiction ficlet giantkiller wuxia werealligator fictionalist cenobite maycomb punk fabrication munchausenism fabulize er metafiction nonfiction gothic baddie fusion falseness acme spacedive tricorder redshirt handwavium werejackal continuity ballardian werelion explodium cyberfiction edisonade noblebright pretense romaction zombocalypse wereleopard ruritanian manfiction fable

evening , i do like to make cakes <eou> Do you like chocolate cakes that are flavored with melted chocolate ? <eou> love chocolate cake , but i cannot eat too much , diet <eou> I love it to , but I am in the same boat as you with the diet , so I have been experimenting with using different ingredients . I have found a few alternative sweeteners that make it delicous and low calorie . You should try it . <eou> really ? what is the sweetener ? <eou> I use stevia . It is extracted from the leaves of a plant called Stevia rebaudiana . It takes some getting used to but is worth it . <eou> okay , i am aware of it but it only comes in packets i think and not in bulk for baking <eou> You can get stevia drops that are a liquid for and very concentrated . The only problem is some brands can have a bitter taste so you have to be careful not to ruin your cake . <eou> i may try it but I need to find a recipe on how to use it <eou> 	You can use it just as you would any other sweetner , but you would have to look up a conversion chart . One option is to use chocolate chips sweetened with stevia instead of sugar too .

I hope you are doing well . I was wondering the other day that if we should still do American Civil War reenactment <eou> I think the reenactment of real battles in history are perfectly fine , many hobbyists love Civil War reenactments <eou> Yes , but they do not represent current lives and it is difficult to relate . <eou> Those who like to participate can those who do not know history do not have to , this is mainly done in the US , but other countries like the UK , Germany and others also do these and they did not have the Civil War <eou> The problem I see is that it is mainly on the field battle that we see , but the real war happened behind closed doors ( politicians ) and we put to much focus on the reenactment of battles . <eou> You know reenactments of the Cicil War actually began before the real battle had even ended <eou> I did not know that , but still why ? From what you are telling me , it seems more for amusement ( theater ) than history . What about other wars that the US was part of . Even the American Revolution does not see as much reenactment . <eou> there are reenactments of all of the wars , the Civil War being most popular because it was fought on US soil , and it was US against US , the biggest popularity came between the 80 ' s and 90 ' s <eou> Have you ever attended a reenactment . I have not ? Maybe I should , I might be missing something . <eou> I have been once , not really into that but a lot of the reinactors were decendants of those who actually fought , years ago the actual veterans would reenact to honor they fallen comrades <eou> 	Thank you for the information , I learned something . Lets talk later .	wondering hope reenactment doing day <eou> fine perfectly reenactment reenactments love battles real hobbyists history <eou> difficult current lives relate represent <eou> mainly participate countries history <eou> field battle war focus politicians doors reenactment happened closed battles real mainly <eou> actually real battle reenactments <eou> telling amusement reenactment theater wars history <eou> popularity 80 popular soil 90 reenactments biggest wars fought <eou> attended reenactment missing <eou> ago fallen honor reenact actual lot veterans comrades fought actually <eou>  <expand> like war peace event present big defeat adjective very people battle story person future historic art act time two world history news part really enemy real historical fact fight god reenact acting course warrior land actually existence fiction actual realistic medicine past horse recent wars computing attack dream glory positive performance recapitulation reenactments enactment repetition work play period age acre common earth modern levy legal ground dance human image mathematics actualize lot particular us existent property be long storytelling heraldry geography area events school fate place force capital republic military large field general army good love religion dialectal box pass describe game action experience has flag date hexahemeron segment minute tdih vowels uk being small charge close dead reenactment magic home lovelore kind british doll lots live embattled reality genuine realsome bodily fake truth realize wax virtual concrete currency thingly bit estate arc soothfast substantial simulated true coke flow beingly serious factual effective deal native science passed ago math years centesimation important mammoth geo name colony times lebensraum old social ancient academy modernity century historize account recentism narrate metropolis cotton nonscience chronicle river now country most engage tropæum camp space battlefield movie unbattled activity town opportunity have happiness city feeling reward writing unit nice section measurement tree language birthday dunam weather dust surface better praise quite value prize opposition tlaco unfeigned proper echt character framis tangible realtor realizingly fictional authenticate decoy imaginary relic rational unsimulated piastre antireal brazil universe authentic windmill false superreal courtesy nonreality ninepence objectify unreality pistareen occur commodity exists quasianalytic nominal number realise cob realest realtime copositive fraud correct orbifold subsidiary bogus hyperreal wonderland agent inflation counterfeit absolute realness reais slang realspace tychism actorfic gradely phase grammar concretize softmax hypermarket veridical objective economics germany feigned faction fictionalize truthful artificial literal thingal realism sincere cyberreal legitimate verisimilar otherworldly

When I hear the word , equestrian , I have to wonder why we can ' t just say horse rider . <eou> It is interesting you say that , equestrian is derived from Latin .

I only road for tourism reasons . Have you ever ridden a horse ? <eou> I have done a few trail rides at the state parks . It is fun . <eou> 	I agree , personally I am a bigger fan of recreational riding compared to horse racing .

Other people disagree with that . What do you think ? <eou> I do think they are an art form - so much creativity goes into creating them ! <eou> For sure ! I like how many different platforms you can use . People game on computers all the way down to small handheld devices . <eou> My first gaming platform was the Commodore Vic 20 - that was a very long time ago ! <eou> Wow !

Cream cheese is also delicious . <eou> Yes I agree cream cheese tastes amazing on cake . Do you know how many calories are in a piece of cake ? <eou> Gee , it completely depends on the ingredients and who makes them . The English fairy cakes vary in size a lot . The American cup cake is more of a standard size . <eou> Yes i find it wild how cakes can be so different in so many countries , It seems that each country has their own specific flavors . <eou> Totally . Years ago before muffin tins were invented the cup cakes were made in little individual pottery cups . Today you cake even bake a little cake in a coffee mug in the microwave ! <eou> Thats fascinating , I guess back then they had very limited ways to cook cakes . <eou> 	Exactly , and back in the early 19th century they had two different terms to describe different varieties .

And I prefer the crust sweet , not salty <eou> I prefer the filled kind too , otherwise there is too much crust . Also , there is a kind called top crust , where the filling is only on the bottom and the crust is only on top ? <eou> I like the one with the crust on the bottom , and not on top . That ' s a little too much . I do like a little crumble though . <eou> Yeah the crust on top seems like a mess , so I have never made one like that . I think my favorite pie to make is apple . <eou> I ' ve never made one from scratch . I need to do it one day though . I prefer eating them over making them <eou> After the apples are cut it is a breeze !

I really like pecan pie . It ' s my favorite ! <eou> I only recently started eating it . It never sounded good because its nuts with a filling of eggs butter and corn syrup but it is ! <eou> It ' s really good . Unhealthy but good ! <eou> Another thing I like about it is depending on what you have on hand you can use brown sugar , sugar syrup , molasses , maple syrup , or honey . <eou> I ' ve never had it with any of those .

I love going to " pay for what you pick " farms . My young son used to eat more blueberries than he put in his pan . <eou> I say I ' m going to do that every year and I never do . That sounds like fun . <eou> The blueberry plants flower until they get the berries . There are a lot of varieties , but my son could easily pick them because the bushes are short . Strawberry picking is fun too . <eou> I love blueberries and strawberries and they seem to taste even better when freshly picked . And I guess it ' s cheaper to pick them yourself too . <eou> I actually started because I figured it was cheaper . It is slightly cheaper , but not significantly . I think they secretly build in extra costs to pay for what your kid eats ! <eou> That ' s funny , but very true I guess . I would probably be just as bad as a kid my first time and give myself a stomachache . <eou> Ha ha ! I was bad my first time , too ! Fruit picking is very social . In face , apple picking used to be a dating ritual in the Midwest , where I live . <eou> That ' s an interesting ritual . I used to live near an orchard growing up . Brings back so many memories , but never went berry picking . I regret that now . <eou> It ' s never too late to start ! I recommend going early in the morning before it gets too hot . <eou> 	That ' s a great idea .

Carrots are definitely one of my favorite vegetables . They taste really good whether they are raw or roasted , which I love . <eou> I love them too ! I ' m a big health nut , so I always eat them for their high amounts of alpha and beta - carotene , vitamin K , and vitamin B6 . <eou> Oh cool ! So which of those health components are what make them good for your eyesight , the carotenes ? <eou> I ' m glad you asked that , because it gives me the opportunity to tell you that it ' s actually a myth that carrots help your eyesight , started by the British in World War II ! <eou> Really ?

I love fishing I just wish I could be better at it <eou> There are different techniques such as spearing , netting , angling and trapping - do you do any of those ? <eou> No i just do angling but my dad has used a net in the past ! <eou> There are a lot of people that do it for a living - according to statistics there are about 38 million fishermen and fish farmers in the world . <eou> I had no idea they had that many ! Is it true for deep sea fishing you need a special licenses . <eou> A fishing license is basically a mechanism to control fishing .

I love dark chocolate <eou> Me too ...

Cacao has been cultivated in Mesoamerica for around 3 , 000 years .

Hello ! Do you enjoy singing ? I was in my choir in High School <eou> I do most of my singing in the car lol . I would love to sing better but it really requires time , dedication , instruction and regular practice . <eou> I had a good friend in college who wanted topublish music and one time I had a chance to sing one of the songs he had written . But just with him listening . <eou> Wow . You must be pretty good . Do you sing a lot as a hoppy or are you interested in it as a profession ? <eou> Well , at least I had choir experience , but I have never had lessons , so I am just as likely to be on key with the car radio as I am to be off key . I only really sing now for myself . It ' s fun , but I don ' t want to be a performer . I don ' t think I would enjoy that . <eou> That ' s how I feel , but at least you ' ve had some great experience . Do you ever sing Karaoke ? <eou> Actually , I have , but ony once . It was fun . A group of us went put after work and we all sang several songs , some solo and some with a group . Have you ever taken lessons , earlier it sounded like you knew it would take practice and instruction . It sounded like maybe you had studied <eou> No , I ' ve had no training but always wanted to . I know that when practice is done on a regular basis , the voice can become more clear and strong . I guess I wish I had pursued this ideas sooner . <eou> well , it ' s never to late to follow a dream . Plus now you can learn about everything online . I ' ll bet there ' s a virtual voice coach app that could get you started . I didn ' t realize that your voice improves with the voice lessons or with practice . <eou> So , you ' ve inspired me !

I never appreciated country music until I forced myself to listen to it for a month or so because my coworkers kept blasting it on their speaker . <eou> 	Haha !

It ' s all delicious ! <eou> I would really like to go to Italy for authentic Italian food . <eou> I ' ve been and it ' s amazing . I love how their chefs rely on quality ingredients rather that quantity . The flavors really shine ! <eou> Im so jealous . Is there a main ingredient in Italian food ? <eou> Well pasta , obviously . Italians also make full use of lots of vegetables and fish , and cook mainly with olive oil . <eou> That all sounds fantastic . What kind of dishes should I try out ? <eou> It depends where you go . For example , the Naples area specializes in using rural ingredients and seafood . Other regions have their own specialties . Pizza ' s pretty good too ! <eou> I love pizza . I bet their tomato sauces are amazing . <eou> 	It is . Tomatoes and other vegetables were introduced to the area in the 18th century .

I own a sweetheart of a Pit bull and an old American bull dog , I am in love with both of them <eou> That sounds awesome . I like all dogs , I heard pit bulls and bull dogs are loyal dogs , might get territorial as well . Not for everyone but they ' re sweet . <eou> Yeah it ' s unfortunate but it ' s all in their bloodline . If they were from a lineage that was born to fight , dog fighting is what they want to do . It ' s cruel that people bet against animal violence for fun <eou> I agree , there is nothing more cruel than that , people think it ' s somehow fun to make dogs suffer , I hate to see it . I think each owner gets a dog in their own image though as far as character goes . <eou> For sure , some people get them to love them , and others like Michael Vick one of the best and highest paid quarterbacks , still didn ' t have enough money so used dog fights for income <eou> Making dogs suffer just for money is really cruel , this kind of people has no morals . I have a deer chihuahua so I ' m definitely a dog loving person . <eou> They ' re so cute ! I ' ve never heard of a Deer Chihuahua but they are named afrer the state of Chihuahua in Mexico ! <eou> Yeah Deer Chihuahuas are closer to original Aztec Techichi ' s which they come from , they ' re a bit bigger than the tiny ones that are popular . And yes They come from Chihuaheno Mountains . <eou> They are the smallest breed of dog too ! I love them because they are NATURAL . People keep breeding these poor dogs unnaturally small and it gives them health issues .

I eat way too many french fries . Some people call them chips in Brattain or finger chips in India . Do you like them ? <eou> I do like fries . Why do they have so many different names ? <eou> I really don ' t know honestly . They ' re the same thing served hot , soft or crispy and eaten for lunch or dinner . I guess people just gave them different names geographically . <eou> That is interesting . What are the best condiments to eat with fries ? I prefer ketchup <eou> Ketchup is always a classic for sure . Some more adventurous types will eat them with vinegar , mayonnaise and even other toppings . <eou> I ' ve dipped them in ice cream before and it was pretty good . When were fries invented ? <eou> I don ' t know if anyone knows to be honest . They were always prepared by cutting and peeling the potatoes , but when it started may be lost in history . <eou> 	That ' s interesting .

I like it to be whatever the artist wants it to be . <eou> I also do enjoy it , Ive found a lot of good indie bands on soundcloud . What are some good recommendations of indie artists ? <eou> Well , in the 2000s , groups like Arcade Fire , Death Cab for Cutie , and Sonic Youth really enjoyed commercial success . <eou> Oh cool , I ' ll have to check them out some time , Was indie music always around or is it a fairly new genre ? <eou> Recently . It really started in the UK in the 50s and 60s , when many artists launched independent labels because major labels had too much power . <eou> Wow I never knew that , I agree some major labels just own too much music and people are afraid of copyrights and stuff . <eou> Yeah , those are definitely major issues . It ' s to the point that indie record labels have 66 % of all music titles . That exist . Anywhere . <eou> Wow 66 %, thats insane , I had no idea they were that popular , Do you know if indie artists play at converts ? <eou> Of course , alt - rock groups play all over the world all the time .

I spent my childhood in one . <eou> Abroad there are a charities that continue to fund orphanages ; however some are funded by smaller charities and religious groups <eou> Thats neat . Glad that there are people out there who really care about the children enough to keep them open with charities . I always donate money to a charity every year and I ensure that my money goes to one that does stuff I believe in .

They should make some kind of incentive for spaying and neutering . Do you know much else about animal shelters ? <eou> there is actually no government run organization that provides oversight or regulation of shelters on a national basis in the us . so basically these shelters are unregulated for the most part :/ <eou> I didn ' t know that . I feel like there definitely should be some sort of laws or at least monitoring . The government is in everything else . <eou> well some positive news many states do regulate shelters within their jurisdiction so while theres no national oversight some states try to do their part when / if they can ! <eou> 	That makes me feel a bit better .

I wish they would all be shut down . <eou> I agree . Puppy Mills are horrible . They value profit over the welfare of the animals . Sometimes Im so saddened by what humans will do for profit . <eou> Greed is rampant in this day and age . I feel so sorry for the conditions of the female dogs of the mills , being bred over and over again . <eou> Yes , and they often develop mammary tumors from repeatedly having babies without care being given to the mothers . so sad ! <eou> Poor things , I wish I could take all of them in . They probably never see medical care at all . <eou> I agree , and they often have genetic disorders which cause them to live short lives due to their inbreeding .

Last night I had a great 6 oz sirloin steak from Texas Roadhouse . It was pretty good . Are you a steak eater yourself ? <eou> I LOVE steak whether it be grilled , broiled , or stir - fried !

I know there are so many ways to cook them and so many types . <eou> I prefer a grilled steak that has been marinated and served with a big baked potato ! lol <eou> The baked potato is almost a staple with steaks . Although for me , I prefer a fried potato . Fried potatoes , just slightly burnt are great . I also like my steak cooked medium to medium well . I like it a little pink . <eou> Oh I adore french fries ! I love them crispy and could basically eat them by themselves as a snack ! I also love my steak medium - slightly pink . <eou> I prefer the " steak " fries . A bit larger than french fries . The thing I have come to find about most fast food restaurants is that they do not cook their french fries long enough . They are too soft and not done enough . When I fry them , or when I go to a restaurant like Texas Roadhouse , they are cooked just right . Crispy , even a little burnt is good with me . What do you think ? <eou> I ' m totally with you ! I love them crispy - not mushy ! I love big fat steak fries and now you have made me hungry ! lol <eou> Well , what type of steak do you like best ? Sirloin ?

What do you think about chicken ? <eou> I LOVE chicken . Especially crispy fried chicken ! <eou> Cool . I love to eat chicken as well . I had a pet chicken as a child though . <eou> So does that mean you don ' t eat chicken as a source of food then ? <eou> I do actually ! In fact , the reason I had the pet chicken was because when we moved into the farm house they had removed all the chicken that were there before we lived there . However , this one chicken had hidden behind the chicken coop door . The previous people made a deal with me over the course of a few months that they would give me a kitten if I gave them their chicken . I accepted because I didn ' t have much of a choice as a child and farm life is different than city life . Anyway , they said I had fattened it up well and it was the best chicken they ever ate . <eou> hahaha that is the most bizarre story I ' ve ever heard . I bet they made chicken and waffles <eou> lol ! I don ' t think they knew about chicken and waffles in that part of the world , but maybe ... :) <eou> What part of the world is that ? I ' m from the south and soul food is the best ! Can ' t imagine being without it . <eou> Northern midwest near Canada . I love soul food too :) I adore well made greens .

Divorce seems to be running rampant these days . The bonds of matrimony seem less meaningful than ever before . <eou> I definitely agree . People jump into getting married , that ' s why .

Of course she wants to get married , but I take that commitment very seriously . I ' m trying to make sure everything is in order to set us up for success before I take the plunge . <eou> I think that is a great idea . My boyfriend and I have been living together for 8 years now . I am still learning new things about him daily . We hope to get married someday , but no rush because neither of us want to get divorced . <eou> Totally on the same page . Divorce laws also scare me . She and I are both working professionals and the thought of the monetary and legal implications of divorce have me treading lightly . It ' s just that prenups aren ' t exactly romantic . <eou> Definitely ! I never understood a prenup . I always thought it showed lack of faith that things would work out . You would always have it looming over your head . <eou> Agreed . Although I ' ve always thought that a simple prenup with a binding arbitration agreement would be prudent . In other words : if we get divorced , we agree not to take it to court and to settle it between ourselves . <eou> 	Yes , I see no problem with that !

It falls between Paleolithic and Neolithic ! <eou> yea thats what i was thinking about , the flinstones . what types of fish did they have back then <eou> Catfish and Tilapia for sure , I hear mullets were even worshiped ! <eou> oh that sounds yummy <eou> I ' m sure a diet in fish was good back then , protein for a harder life ! <eou> yea , with some alcohol on the side , if they knew how to make it back then ! <eou> I ' m sure they did , I think imbibing in spirits has been around forever .

My parents were divorced when I was around 10 - that means that they terminated their marriage . It was hard on my sister and I . <eou> Divorce is roughest on the kids . I am glad that states have made it easier to get divorced , with many allowing " no - fault " dissolutions . <eou> The laws do seem to vary around the world but most countries do require the sanction of the courts to help resolve a lot of the issues that come up . <eou> Amazing to think that some places divorce is illegal . I shudder to think what it must be like to be trapped like that . <eou> At least in the US the courts can kinda step in and help figure out all the child custody , support , visitation , property and debt issues . <eou> Sometimes it is necessary for the judge to decide those issues when the parents can ' t work it out . <eou> And there are so many reasons for divorce , I think one of the biggest can be a personality clash . <eou> 	Yeah sometimes people just can ' t get along . In those cases it is best for the kids if they get divorced .	parents marriage 10 divorced sister hard terminated means <eou> kids divorced easier am fault roughest glad allowing dissolutions <eou> resolve require issues help countries lot vary world courts sanction laws <eou> trapped illegal shudder divorce <eou> property step child help kinda courts visitation debt custody figure support issues <eou> parents judge decide issues <eou> biggest divorce clash reasons personality <eou>  <expand> person law legal people family support divorce marriage house problem issue children father being trouble computing action part human parent child like good ground help alimony music nice call place small judge daughter baby home dad uncle cousin son affair divorcing divorcee connected single legally member mother dissolve living money little motion let determine peace need current student give stead care nation big us measure punishment visitation up everyone childs dismarry infidelity divortiality married do marry divorced contract slang female nephew adjective coal graft pound tree scale floor attribute card manner stick book access capital out try really alternate bootstrap hide operation class balloon toy doll facilitate line responsibility serve relief dissolution square constitution purpose calculate adjudicate conclude decision decide request ask cyberissues supporting chevisance volunteer plea logic bield profit promote servant adjument encourage helpful comfort helping assistance giving abet someone subventitious aid machine advice documentation assist continent real group amount area wealth space everything time man nature court lawyer name talaq rule separate hotchpot gett maintenance get decree attachment culture term one adopt trial god declare sheep rents protect orphancy party orphanry orphanship kidfluence babymoon disparented babies orphanhood orphandom warphan folks parentals waithood dotation lock role dowry husband relationship parapherna wedding union sororate yoke plight handfast love step relation minister stale ring match blood act ganancial perfect undivorced unmarried cut dissolved nondivorced widow split separated repudiated engaged families boy young service parts relative habit beam monk girl brother science ease egg difficult bone solid office feeling consistency rocky rock hammer branch hardstep steel description blow hardship hardhead scarce bed drugs diligence heroin shell heavy ice exercise standard life shoe close slave door nautical find physics cover test easy board firm impossible rough soft assignment job boundary reply cost compare double resource lifeline application carry large end also extenuation goal

My parents divorced when I was young because of a personality clash <eou> That has got to be tough . My parents are still together so I dont have much experience with divorce . <eou> It ' s a dissolution of marriage thereby dissolving the bonds of matrimony . It ' s a difficult process ! <eou> I have heard that a divorce can take a while . Im guessing it has to go through the legal process at court ? <eou> Yes , it does need the sanction of a court especially regarding alimony and child custody . <eou> Yea I forget about that when I think about divorces . <eou> It can get quite complicated when there ' s so many things to settle , like child support , distribution of property , and division of debt . <eou> 	Im sure that can be really hard to through .
